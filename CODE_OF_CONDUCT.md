# Code of Conduct

Please accept, that we can't approve every pull request immediately. We have to do certain things before a patch can go into Univention products:
* **Check for side effects**: Changes might introduce regressions or break behavior for other existing customers.
* **Adjust the documentation**
* **Consider security or usability aspects**
* **Prioritize against other tasks**: We are working on many topics, sometimes other things are more urgent.
* **Release management**: We need to decide which UCS release fits best.

You have influence on the time we take:

* **Be open and friendly**
* **Be patient**
* **Be agreeable**: Sometimes, we have another opinion.
* **Use English language**: Our preferred language is English. This makes it easier for all contributors to understand each other.
* **Provide relevant details**: Describe your environment and the problem, how it can be reproduced and how it was solved.
* **Think about other users**: Is the feature helpful for many users? Or is the change customer specific. Might there be a better solution which uses or provides an API?
* **Stick to the Style guide**
