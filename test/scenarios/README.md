AutotestErrrata
---------------
Description:

Personal environments via Jenkins Job
=====================================

Altough every scenario can be started on the local computer via the docker tool ucs-ec2/kvm-create, sometimes it is easier to have a dedicated Jenkins Job for certain environments
* Because jenkins-data does not have to be in sync (at least in the personal computer)
* It is even easier to just press on a button
* We can provide meaningful defaults

Personal environments just means, that the name of the instance starts with the uid of the user that started the job.

To create a such a job, add the job to the appropriate seed script in univention/dist/jenkins>, e.g.
```
def ram_kvm = job("${cuas.jenkins_folder_name}/RAM-environment") {
    displayName('Create RAM Environment in KVM')
    description('Create an school env with a primary and a backup with the rankine APIs.')
    logRotator(28, 3, -1, -1)
    label(label_agents)
    wrappers {
        preBuildCleanup()
        timestamps()
    }
    parameters {
        configure EC2Tools.extensibleChoice('KVM_BUILD_SERVER', 'KVM_BUILD_SERVER', 'ranarp.knut.univention.de')
    }
    steps {
        shell('cd test && exec ./utils/ram/start-kvm.sh')
    }
}
EC2Tools.addUpdateParameters(ram_kvm, false, false)
EC2Tools.addUcsGit(ram_kvm, cucs.mmm, '/test/scenarios', '/test/utils')
```

and a start wrapper somewhere in univention/dev/ucs>test/utils

```
#!/bin/bash

set -x
set -e

export KVM_BUILD_SERVER="${KVM_BUILD_SERVER:=tross.knut.univention.de}"
export TERMINATE=false     # do not destroy instances after setup
export DOCKER=true         # use docker
export REPLACE=true        # replace existing instances
export UCS_TEST_RUN=false  # don't execte use-test

# user specific instances "username_..."
export KVM_OWNER="${BUILD_USER_ID:=$USER}"
export JOB_BASE_NAME="${JOB_BASE_NAME:=ram-env}"

exec ./utils/start-test.sh scenarios/autotest-248-ram-rankine.cfg
```

`BUILD_USER_ID` is set by jenkins to the uid of current logged in user and `KVM_OWNER` instructs ec2-kvm-create to create an instance with this "name" (pmueller_master-ucsschool-env) -> So this creates instances with YOUR uid in the name.

Best practice
-------------

* Whenever possible it is best to re-use an existing scenario file from a test job, so that we don't have to maintain multiple version of a scenario
* `export UCS_TEST_RUN=false` to disable ucs-test (so only setup, not tests), keep in mind to also add this to the environment section of the scenario file, so that the instnaces can see this varibale


UCS Branch Tests
================

In order to test change from feature branches we need a way to add repositories to our test instances (via our scenario files), for that we have `utils.sh::add_extra_apt_scope()` and the `SCOPE` parameter/env var for jobs. The value can have different meanings:

**string with ://**

* uses SCOPE as apt repository
* adds this as repository to the apt sources

**string with one /**

* uses `SCOPE` as UCS branch name
* adds `http://omar.knut.univention.de/build2/git` sources list for corresonding repository
* adds apt.conf for that repo with priority 1001 (install, downgrade from this repo)

**string**

* uses `SCOPE` as repo-ng build scope
* adds scope to source.list

Jenkins
-------

The idea is that we have dedicated jenkins jobs for different scenarios which can be used to test the "pipeline" packages from ucs feature branches (or packags from a custome scope).

* because we don't want to spoil the history of the daily jobs
* make it as easy as possible for dev's to start branch tests

These jenkins jobs

* a required parameter `SCOPE`
* checks out this ucs branch and starts the scenario
* adds the gitlab branch repo and from that on just the usual setup and test runs

See https://jenkins2022.knut.univention.de/job/UCS-5.0/job/UCS-5.0-6/view/Branch%20test%20(WIP)/ for what we have so far.

New jobs can be added in the jenkins seed file in the univention/dist/jenkins repository.
