		### Just locking would be good, but requires ppolicy LDAP overlay
		### active and configured properly to temporarily block LDAP
		### authentication too. For now we additionally disable the user in this case:
		HOME=/ /usr/sbin/univention-directory-manager users/user modify --dn "$user_dn" --set disabled=1
		### FYI: disabling a users/user object automatically resets locked to 0, this is Samba/AD
		### behavior too. This causes the faillog listener to directly reset the pam_faillock counter.
