App lifecycle
*************

.. highlight:: console

This section relates the lifecycle of an app from the first app
development, its life in the public to termination. The lifecycle
applies to the app overall and to every single version.

.. _development:

Development
===========

Every app starts with its development. It involves the definition of the
app in the App Provider Portal, providing the software solution as a
Docker image, see :ref:`Get Started <get-started>`, and the integration of
the solution with UCS, for example in the identity management area, see
:ref:`Connection with Identity Management <connection-idm>`. This part of
the lifecycle can be divided into two steps: setup and integration.

.. _development-best-practice:

Best practice for app development environment
---------------------------------------------

This section briefly describes best practices on the development and
testing environment for apps dedicated to the |UCSAPPC|. The
recommendations aim at reducing repeatable time efforts that, for
example, are caused by the download of Docker images.

The development of apps mainly involves the App Provider portal and a
local instance of |UCSUCR| (UCR). To setup your UCS environment the best
practice is to download one of the UCS virtual machine images and use
VirtualBox or VMware, see :ref:`Download UCS <testing-download>`. After
the installation, :ref:`activate the
system <uv-manual:central-license>`
and copy your SSH key to the UCS system to save typing the password on
each remote console login. Finally, activate the Test App Center, see
:ref:`Test App Center <testing-test-app-center>`. With that status it's
a good time to make a snapshot of the system, which allows to got back
to that status. Afterwards, app specific time consuming tasks can be
prepared to reduce recurring waiting times. Among them are for example
an optional :command:`docker login` to gain access to a private Docker image or
even the own Docker registry, and the manual download of the app's
Docker image(s) with :command:`docker pull` (for single container apps) or
:command:`docker-compose -p $appid pull` (for multi container apps) from the
within the :file:`docker-compose.yml` directory of the app, see
:ref:`Debugging <testing-debugging>`. And then also make a new snapshot.
Especially, having the Docker image(s) locally saves download time
during recurring installation test cycles.

With the last snapshot there is a prepared system that can serve as
starting point for app installation and associated testing. The
development iteration cycles are a dance of changes in the App Provider
portal and testing the installation and app integration. After returning
to a snapshot, it's recommended to update the local App Center cache.
This is either automatically done during login and opening of the App
Center module in the UCS management system or triggered manually with
:command:`univention-app update` on the console.

.. _testing:

Testing
=======

Testing the app is the final part of its development. It typically
involves a combination of manual and automatic tests. In order to test
the app with UCS, please follow these instructions.

.. _testing-download:

Download UCS
------------

Download UCS to get a copy of UCS free of charge from the `Univention
website <ucs-download_>`_. Choose
an ISO image or a pre-installed virtual machine image for various
virtualization hypervisors, like for example VMware (ESXi and
Workstations), VirtualBox and KVM.

.. _testing-setup:

Initial UCS setup
-----------------

Please refer to the `Quickstart Guide for Univention Corporate Server
<ucs-quickstart_>`_ for the first
steps about installation and initial setup.

.. _testing-test-app-center:

Test App Center
---------------

Switch to the Test App Center Repository and test the app directly on
the UCS system set up before.

.. code-block::

   $ univention-install univention-appcenter-dev
   $ univention-app dev-use-test-appcenter

.. _testing-install:

Install the app
---------------

Up until here, the app is available in the Test App Center and a UCS
system is up and running that is configured against the Test App Center.
The app can be installed via the |UCSUMC|. UMC consists of several modules
and one of them is called :guilabel:`App Center`. Open this module and install the
app from there.

.. _testing-install-app-center-umc-module:

.. figure:: /images/umc-module-app-center.png
   :alt: Univention Management Console overview with App Center Module

   Univention Management Console overview with App Center Module


The following points are mandatory for the App to be published:

* The App has to install without user interaction. Exceptions are
  configuration parameters obtained through App Settings, see :ref:`App
  settings <app-settings>`.

* The App may not negatively impact UCS' core services.

* The App has to uninstall without leaving any remainders that
  interfere with UCS' core services.

* The app is working with the UCS versions that are configured as
  Supported UCS version, see :ref:`Supported UCS
  versions <create-app-with-docker-supported-ucs-version>`.

When installing the App, also mind :file:`README` information that may have
been defined on the :guilabel:`Additional texts` tab in the app in the App Provider
Portal after activating it with the option :guilabel:`Additional texts with
information for UCS system administrators` on the Overview tab in the
*Modules* section. An Administrator expects an app to be fully configured
after the installation. If something is needed in order to use the app,
such as activating users for the service, it should be described in the
appropriate README section, see :ref:`README for the
administrator <readme>`.

.. _testing-upgrade:

Upgrade the app
---------------

Once several versions of the app exist, the upgrade should be tested, as
well. The App Center UMC module only allows the installation of the
latest app version. To test an upgrade of the app, please go to the
console and install a version explicitly:

.. code-block::

   $ univention-app install myapp=1.0

Afterwards, go back to the App Center UMC module. There, the app should
show up with the update symbol indicating the availability of an update.
Continue and perform the app upgrade.

.. _testing-checklist:

Test checklist
--------------

The following list gives an idea what the app provider should test
before the app is approved for release or update. The list cannot cover
all possible items, but mentions what is missed repeatedly.

*  Integration with UCS identity management: Does the login with
   activated users work? Will the login be blocked for users that are
   not activated for the app?

*  Environment with proxy: How does the app behave when a proxy is
   configured in the UCS environment? Does the app take the proxy
   settings into account? Does the app work as expected? Is the
   networking still working properly for the app?

*  Description and documentation: Are the texts consistent in content?
   Can they be understood easily? Is the description of technical steps
   complete and correct, especially path and file names?

.. _testing-deactive-test-app-center:

Deactivate the Test App Center
------------------------------

To switch back to the productive App Center, please run:

.. code-block::

   $ univention-app dev-use-test-appcenter --revert

.. _testing-automation-for-providers:

Automated testing for App Providers
-----------------------------------

Univention always runs automated tests on an app before it's released.
This testing infrastructure can be used by the app provider to increase
the test coverage for the app. This can save manual testing efforts.

A test script for the app can be provided in the :guilabel:`Testing` tab. The script
needs to be entered in the text area :guilabel:`Test script run after installation`.
It's run together with the automatic app tests in the Univention test
infrastructure and will be executed after the app has been installed
during those tests.

On successful tests, the script has to end with exit code ``0``.
``--binddn`` and ``--bindpwdfile`` are passed, so that the command line
interface of UDM can be used easily. Here is an example:

.. code-block:: bash

   #!/bin/sh
   set -e
   udm users/user create "$@" \
     --set username=myapp-test-user \
     --set password=s3cr3t-pwd \
     --set lastname=Test \
     --set myappActivated=TRUE
   sleep 10
   curl http://localhost/myapp/login ...

For certain tests user credentials for access to the directory service
are needed. They are passed with the parameters ``binddn`` and
``bindpwd``. In many cases the user *Administrator* is used. The
Administrator credentials are only important for UDM calls on UCS
systems that are not the |UCSPRIMARYDN|.

The test script can be manually tested.

.. code-block::

   $ univention-install univention-appcenter-dev
   $ univention-app dev-use-test-appcenter
   $ univention-app install my-app
   $ univention-app dev-test-setup  # installs common testing libs like selenium
   $ univention-app dev-test \
     --appcenter-server http://appcenter-test.software-univention.de \
     my-app \
     --binddn "$DN" \
     --bindpwd "$BINDPWD"

.. _testing-debugging:

Debugging
---------

During app development or for problem analysis it may be necessary to
debug an app. If an app installation fails, the App Center removes the
Docker container and thus prevents the developer to have a deeper look
into what happened. With the following command the App Center will not
throw away a failed app installation. The container is kept on the
system.

.. code-block::

   $ univention-app install myapp --do-not-revert

For debugging or support cases it can be helpful to enter the app
container. The following command opens a shell in the container.

.. code-block::

   $ univention-app shell myapp

If the container does not support a shell, the container can be entered
with the plain Docker commands.

.. code-block::

   $ CONTAINER="$(ucr get appcenter/apps/myapp/container)"
   $ docker exec "$CONTAINER" ...

To view the Docker log files for the app, please use the following
command:

.. code-block::

   $ univention-app logs $appid  # equivalent to docker logs $CONTAINER

For multi container apps using Docker compose, those logging information
can be viewed with:

.. code-block::

   $ cd /var/lib/univention-appcenter/apps/$appid/compose
   $ docker-compose -p "$appid" logs

Important log files on the UCS host for debugging are:

*  :file:`/var/log/univention/appcenter.log`
*  :file:`/var/log/univention/management-console-module-appcenter.log`
*  :file:`/var/log/univention/join.log`
*  :file:`/var/log/docker.log`

.. _approval:

Two-way approval
================

Testing the app also involves giving an approval for the release of the
app. Each app in the App Center requires a two-way approval, one from
the app provider and one from Univention. The app provider starts with
the process and performs the tests to give the approval for its app.

The app provider's approval is given by clicking on :guilabel:`Approve for release`
in the App Provider Portal. The |UCSAPPC| team is notified and they will
start the automated tests. As soon as the automated tests are
successful, the second approval is available and the app is ready to be
released.

The automated tests conducted by Univention test for installation,
un-installation and re-installation of the app for different UCS system
roles. They check for proper operation of the UCS services. No app
functionality will be tested. The tests are for ensuring that the app
does not break UCS functionality.

Besides the technical testing, the first release also undergoes a manual
review process on the app presentation. The app description is checked
for plausibility, understandability and for the App Center context.

.. _release:

Release
=======

As soon as the app is ready for release, it's copied to the productive
App Center by the |UCSAPPC| team. This involves the app's presentation
material as well as the Docker image. Univention maintains an own Docker
registry. The Docker image is copied to that registry and the reference
to the Docker image is updated accordingly in the app definition. The
app will be visible in the App Center UMC module immediately for all UCS
users after release. The app catalog is updated automatically and shows
the new app.

.. _updates:

Updates
=======

After the release of the first version the app enters "maintenance mode"
and receives updates from the app provider. The evolution of an app is
represented by its version. In order to provide an update for the app,
follow these steps:

1. Go to the :guilabel:`Apps` UMC module in the App Provider Portal and search for
   the app.

2. To create a new version of the app, mouse over the app's tile, right click
   and select :guilabel:`New App Version`.

   .. _app-life-cycle-update-create-new-version:

   .. figure:: /images/app_portal_create_new_version.png
      :scale: 80%
      :alt: Menu to add a new App

      Menu to add a new App

3. Enter the values for source and target version. The App Provider
   Portal will then copy the source app configuration to the target.

   .. figure:: /images/app_portal_new_version.png
      :scale: 80%
      :alt: Add a new App version

      Add a new App version

4. Open the new app version and make the appropriate changes, e.g. the
   version tag for the Docker image. Usual places for changes involve
   the scripts and maybe the integration. Texts and logos should be
   checked if they are still up to date.


.. _termination:

Termination (end of life)
=========================

If the app provider decides to discontinue an app and stop maintenance,
the app can be terminated by setting it *end of life*. As soon as an
app is published in status end of life, UCS system administrators won't
be able to install it anymore. UCS systems that already have the app
installed, will show a notification in the App Center that informs the
UCS system administrator that they should look for alternative
solutions.

App versions are not explicitly terminated. They are superseded by the
next version. The termination applies to the whole app.

The app can be terminated by going to the app's configuration in the App
Provider Portal. Please go to the :guilabel:`Advanced` tab to the section
*Custom configuration*. Create a new custom configuration with the
:guilabel:`Custom key` ``EndOfLife`` and the :guilabel:`Custom value` ``True``.
Afterwards press :guilabel:`Save` and :guilabel:`Approve for release`. Please
provide a custom message in the publish dialog and let the App Center team know
about the reasons for the termination.

.. _upload-interface:

App Provider Portal upload interface
====================================

An app is configured via the App Provider Portal, which offers a web
interface. There is also an upload interface available. If the developer
prefers to keep the app configuration in a version control system, the
upload interface offers a good way to push changes for the app to the
Test App Center. The script can also be used in non-interactive mode
within other scripts. In such cases username and password should be
stored in separate files (no new line at the end) that are passed as
parameters.

The scripts needs to be `downloaded <univention-provider-portal-script_>`_.
It requires Python 3.7 and cURL to run. For a list of available actions
and their parameters, use the script's help:

.. code-block::

   $ ./univention-appcenter-control --help
   $ ./univention-appcenter-control upload --help

The following examples show how the script can be used.

.. code-block::

   # creates a new version based on the latest version of myapp
   $ ./univention-appcenter-control new-version 5.2/myapp

   # finds out on which UCS versions this Docker App may be installed
   # Note: jq is an external tool: apt-get install jq
   # you may parse JSON without it, of course
   $ ./univention-appcenter-control get --json 5.2/myapp |
     jq '._ini_vars.SupportedUCSVersions'

   # creates version 2.0 of myapp based on the (formerly) latest version
   $ ./univention-appcenter-control new-version 5.2/myapp 5.2/myapp=2.0

   # sets the DockerImage of the new app
   $ ./univention-appcenter-control set 5.2/myapp=2.0 \
     --json '{"DockerImage": "mycompany/myimage:2.0"}'

   # copies myapp Version 1.0 from UCS 4.4 to UCS 5.2.
   $ ./univention-appcenter-control new-version 4.4/myapp=1.0 5.2/myapp=1.0

   # uploads all README files in the current folder to the latest version
   # myapp in UCS 4.2
   $ ./univention-appcenter-control upload 5.2/myapp README*

   # uploads an image. Will be rejected if this image is not specified
   # somewhere in the ini file. Note: This may overwrite the logo for other
   # version using the same logo name, too.
   $ ./univention-appcenter-control upload 5.2/myapp=1.0 myapp.svg

The script can also be used to automate the creation of a new app
version for an app update. The generics steps are the following:

1. Create a new version in the provider portal via the upload script
   based on the latest published version.

2. For single container apps update the reference to the app's Docker
   image and its version. For multi container apps, download the compose
   file, update the references to the Docker images of the services
   there and upload the compose file.

3. Perform the usual tests before approving an app update for release.

4. Send an email to the App Center team and approve the release. Please
   provide information about the UCS section, the app's version and the
   internal component reference. It's best to provide this information
   in the email's subject and it can look like this: *"Regarding
   4.4/myapp=4.74 (myapp_20201106183244)"*

The following examples show how to run the steps with the upload
interface. The examples assume that the password to the portal is stored
in a password file which is given as parameter to the script:

.. code-block::

    $ APP_UPGRADE_FROM="12.1"
    $ APP_VERSION="12.2"
    $ UCS_MINOR="4.4"
    $ MY_APP="myapp"
    $ MY_USERNAME="my_username"
    $ PWD_FILE="portal_password"

    # 1. Create a new version in the app provider portal
    $ ./univention-appcenter-control new-version \
      --username "$MY_USERNAME" \
      --pwdfile "$PWD_FILE" \
      "$UCS_MINOR/$MY_APP" \
      "$UCS_MINOR/$MY_APP=$APP_VERSION"

    ## First example for single container apps
    # 2. Update the reference to the app Docker image
    $ ./univention-appcenter-control set \
      --username "$MY_USERNAME" \
      --pwdfile "$PWD_FILE" \
      "$UCS_MINOR/$MY_APP=$APP_VERSION" \
      --json '{"DockerImage": "my_company/'"$MY_APP:$APP_VERSION"'"}'

    # 3. Obtain the component id of the new app version.
    # The command asumes the latest component is the new app.
    $ COMPONENT=$(./univention-appcenter-control status \
      --username "$MY_USERNAME" \
      --pwdfile "$PWD_FILE" \
      "$UCS_MINOR/$MY_APP" | sed -rne 's/^ *COMPONENT: +//p;T;q')

    # 4. Send the email
    $ SUBJECT="Regarding $UCS_MINOR/$MY_APP=$APP_VERSION ($COMPONENT)"

    ####
    # Second example for multi container apps
    # 2. Get app configuration data

    $ ./univention-appcenter-control get \
      "$UCS_MINOR/$MY_APP=$APP_VERSION" \
      --json \
      --username "$MY_USERNAME" \
      --pwdfile "$PWD_FILE" > "$MY_APP.json"

    # 3. Extract the compose content
    $ jq -r .compose < "$MY_APP.json" > compose

    # Edit the compose file accordingly. A custom script can help to automate this step.
    # This script depends on the app and the compose file content
    # Replace the "image: " lines and refer to the upstream Docker images and their respective tags

    # 4. Upload altered compose file
    $ ./univention-appcenter-control upload \
      --username "$MY_USERNAME" \
      --pwdfile "$PWD_FILE" \
      --non-interactive \
      "$UCS_MINOR/$MY_APP=$APP_VERSION" compose

    # 5. Send the mail and with subject as described above
