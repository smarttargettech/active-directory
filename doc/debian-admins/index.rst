Welcome to the manual *Univention Corporate Server for Debian and Ubuntu
Administrators*. This document aims for system administrators, system
engineers, or DevOps engineers with knowledge of the administration of Debian
GNU/Linux or Ubuntu systems who want to get started with |UCS|.

The document helps you avoid common pitfalls when starting to work with UCS if
you have a Debian GNU/Linux or Ubuntu background. The document doesn't describe
in detail how to do various tasks *the UCS way*. Instead, it points out the
differences and refers to appropriate resources in the product documentation.

Reading this document, you earn a general understanding of the differences
between Debian GNU/Linux or Ubuntu and |UCS|. A :ref:`list of principles
<principle-summary>` summarizes the key points of this document.

This document assumes that you are familiar with the following topics:

* Installing and updating computer systems running Debian GNU/Linux or Ubuntu.

* A command line in a local or remote shell, such as :program:`bash`.

* A text editor on the command line, such as :program:`GNU nano`,
  :program:`Vim`, or :program:`Emacs`.

* Installing and upgrading software using the package manager :program:`APT`.

* Configuring various services such as mail servers, LDAP servers and Samba.

Your feedback is welcome and highly appreciated. If you have any comments,
suggestions, or criticisms, please `send your feedback
