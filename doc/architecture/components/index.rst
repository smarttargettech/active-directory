Product components
******************

In this part of the document, you learn about the second, medium, and detail
level of the architecture of |UCS|. You learn about UCS product components that
you face directly when you use UCS. The product components typically act as
entry points for your tasks.

The product components descriptions are intended for administrators and solution
architects. For software developers and system engineers, it provides the context
for the architectural details of UCS. Make sure you are familiar with the
:ref:`concepts` behind UCS.

The following product components from :numref:`product-components-model`
introduce themselves in the order you most likely encounter them when you work
with UCS:

#. :ref:`component-portal`
#. :ref:`component-management-system`
#. :ref:`component-app-center`

   #. :ref:`component-file-print`
