Univention app ecosystem
========================

Univention App Center is one of the most important parts of |UCS|. This section
describes the Univention app ecosystem, where UCS is just one part. The
Univention app ecosystem consists of actors, an infrastructure, and artifacts.

This section provides information about the following aspects around the App
Center:

* :ref:`app-center-purpose` about the why of the App Center for administrators
  and app providers.

* :ref:`app-center-ecosystem-actors` in the context of the App Center
  ecosystem.

* :ref:`app-center-ecosystem-apps` for an overview of the content in
  the App repository.

* :ref:`app-center-infrastructure` for the App Center.

Depending on the direction you look at the App Center, it has different purposes
and provides different benefits.

First, the App Center provides value to administrators in terms of software
management:

* Maintained enterprise software integrated with |UCS| identity management. The
  existing integration reduces the effort for customers to maintain such an
  integration.

* Software lifecycle management with simplified installation and updating of
  software applications in a server infrastructure.

* Reliable delivery infrastructure to serve the software lifecycle management.

:numref:`app-center-purpose-model` shows the purposes of the App Center for
customers and app providers.

.. _app-center-purpose-model:

.. figure:: /images/App-Center-purpose.*

   Purpose of the App Center

Second, because the App Center is part of |UCS|, app providers benefit from a
good customer base and an enterprise platform with integrated identity
management. With integrated identity management at their fingertips, app
providers don't have to worry about identity management on their own. They
can rely on the offered interfaces such as LDAP, SAML, and OpenID Connect.

.. TODO : Once the chapters about the authentication protocols exist, convert
   them to cross-references.

App ecosystem
-------------

On the one hand, the App Center is a user-facing product component in |UCS|. The
:ref:`services-app-center` covers the architecture and technology in more
detail. On the other hand, the App Center is also an ecosystem with services,
actors, artifacts, and infrastructure.

This section provides an overview of the ecosystem.

.. _app-center-ecosystem-actors:

App ecosystem actors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. index::
   see: app center role; role

:numref:`app-center-actors` shows the actors involved in the Univention App
Center ecosystem. For the sake of brevity, the figure shows a subset of the
responsibilities.

   Actors in the App Center ecosystem

.. _app-center-ecosystem-infrastructure-maintainer:

App infrastructure maintainer
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. index::
   pair: role; app infrastructure maintainer

*Univention* fulfills the responsibility of the *App infrastructure maintainer*
and as such is responsible for *Univention App Center*. For example, Univention
operates the infrastructure so that administrators can install software through
the App Center.

The *App infrastructure maintainer* also fulfills the responsibilities to
operate the *Univention App provider portal service* and to provide *App
provider support*. Both serve the *App developer* during on-boarding and app
maintenance.

.. _app-center-ecosystem-app-provider:

App provider
""""""""""""

.. index::
   pair: actor; app provider
   pair: actor; app maintainer
   pair: actor; app vendor
   see: app center actor; actor

The next actor in the App Center ecosystem is the *App provider* in the
following specializations:

App maintainer
   The *App maintainer* doesn't own the software, but maintains the app with the
   software in the App Center.

   The App Center also contains open source apps. Organizations that act as *App
   maintainer* don't own the open source software. They invest their knowledge
   of |UCS| and the software in an app, its integration with UCS, and the
   maintenance of the app for the benefit of customers and to promote open
   source software.

App vendor
   The *App vendor* owns the software. Organizations that own software and
   maintain their own app in Univention App Center act in both ways, as *App
   vendor* and *App maintainer* at the same time.

App developer
   The role *App developer* is the primary role that interacts with the
   *Univention App provider portal service* and uses the *App provider support*.

.. _app-center-ecosystem-customer:

Customer
""""""""

.. index::
   pair: actor; customer
   pair: role; user

The third actor is the customer in the role of the user and especially the
*Administrator*. They use *Univention App Center* with the associated services
and apps to cover their software needs for their business.

App artifacts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. index::
   single: app; integration
   single: app; metadata
   single: app; package based app

   single: app; multi container app
   single: docker; single container app
   single: docker; multi container app

The artifacts in the App Center are apps. At the technology level an *App Center
app* consists of the parts shown in :numref:`app-center-apps-aggregation`.

.. _app-center-apps-aggregation:

   :width: 500 px

   Parts of an app

Software application for app
   *Software application for app* is the software itself, the binary artifact as
   provided by the vendor.

App integration
   *App integration* includes scripts and software tailored to the integration
   needs of the software application and |UCS|. They take care of the proper
   setup so that the app is ideally ready to use after installation. For
   example, the integration may consist of:

   * Setup for single sign-on configuration between the software application and
     |UCS|.

   * Configuration to set up the web server.

   * Script to populate a database with the database schema and required data.

   * Environment setup for configuring the software application.

App metadata
   *App metadata* is the content responsible for properly presenting the app to
   the user in the App Center. It includes name, description, logo, and contact
   information for the app provider.

The App Center recognizes the *Software application for app* in the form in
which the vendor distributes the binary artifact, as shown in
:numref:`app-center-apps`.

.. _app-center-apps:

.. figure:: /images/App-Center-apps-2.*
   :width: 350 px

   Kinds of software distribution for the App Center

Package based app
   *Package based app* refers to software distributed using :ref:`Debian
   packages <positioning-packages>`. Apps that extend the core capabilities of
   UCS use Debian packages for software distribution. The App Center installs
   the packages from dedicated repositories per app and handles the repository
   configuration.

Docker based app
   *Docker based app* refers to software distributed through Docker images, a
   data format for containerized software. Docker based apps decouple the
   software runtime from the underlying UCS operating system and reduce the
   complexity of app maintenance for app providers.

   .. important::

      The App Center prefers Docker based apps over package based apps.

Finally, a *Docker based app* can be either a *Single container app* or a *Multi
container app*, as shown in :numref:`app-center-docker-apps`.

.. _app-center-docker-apps:

.. figure:: /images/App-Center-apps-3.*
   :width: 350 px

   Kinds of Docker apps

Single container app
   Individual single container apps consist of a Docker image. UCS uses the
   Docker engine to run them.

Multi container app
   Multi container apps, on the other hand, consist of more than one Docker
   image. UCS uses `Docker compose <docker-compose_>`_ and the Docker engine to
   run them. App providers that offer their app as multi container app often
   provide the required parts as micro services for better decoupling and
   dependency control. They also typically offer this type of deployment anyway,
   independent of the App Center.

:numref:`app-center-apps-model` shows the overall model, its parts and
what an app consists of. On the application level the App Center differentiates
an *App* into *Package based app* and *Docker based app* and handles both.

The App Center requires a dedicated infrastructure consisting of several
elements to function properly.

   App Center infrastructure model

App developer
   An *App developer* is a software developer who is responsible for creating
   and maintaining an app. The *App developer* belongs to the
   :ref:`app-center-ecosystem-app-provider`.

Univention App provider portal service
   The *Univention App provider portal Service* is the entry point for app
   developers who create and maintain an app in the App Center. App developers
   use the *App provider portal* that handles authentication and access rights
   to the app definitions for app developers. And, it uploads the app software
   to the *App repository*.

   Technically, the *App Provider portal* is a :ref:`UMC module
   <services-umc-modules>` running on a dedicated UCS system to manage the *App
   repository*.

App repository
   The *App repository* is the storage location for the app artifacts. UCS systems
   connect to the *App repository* to load the app metadata for presentation and
   to download the app for installation on a UCS system.

   The *App repository* consists of the following parts:

   * *Production App repository* is the location where all UCS systems
     download the apps. It contains the publicly available apps.

   * *App Docker registry* is the location for the Docker images of Docker
     based apps.

   * *Test App repository* is the location for apps under development. Only app
     developers use it during app development. After an app release completes,
     the app appears in the *Production App repository*.

App Catalog
   The *App Catalog* is part of the Univention website and provides an overview
   of the available apps and their descriptions. It's a representation of the
   app metadata for user information purposes. The *App Catalog* loads the data
   from the *App repository*.

App Center
   In the context of :numref:`app-center-infrastructure-model`, the term *App
   Center* of the ArchiMate application component refers to everything on a
   local UCS system that makes up the App Center. The *App Center Service* loads
   the app information from the *App repository*.

   For the architecture of the *App Center*, refer to
   :ref:`services-app-center`.

Administrator
   The *Administrator* is the primary *User* role that interacts with the *App
   Center Service* on a UCS system. The *Administrator* has the user permissions
   to install, update, and remove apps on a UCS system.
