Configuration of hardware and drivers
=====================================

.. _computers-available-kernel-variants:

Available kernel variants
-------------------------

The standard kernel in UCS 5.0 is based on the Linux kernel 4.19. In principle,
there are three different types of kernel packages:

* A *kernel image package* provides an executable kernel which can be installed
  and started.

* A *kernel source package* provides the source code for a kernel. From this
  source, a tailor-made kernel can be created, and functions can be activated or
  deactivated.

* A *kernel header package* provides interface information which is required by
  external packages if these have to access kernel functions. This information
  is usually necessary for compiling external kernel drivers.

Normally, the operation of a UCS system only requires the installation of one
kernel image package.

Several kernel versions can be installed in parallel. This makes sure that there
is always an older version available to which can be reverted in case of an
error. So-called meta packages are available which always refer to the kernel
version currently recommended for UCS. In case of an update, the new kernel
version will be installed, making it possible to keep the system up to date at
any time.

.. _computers-hardware-drivers-kernel-modules:

Hardware drivers / kernel modules
---------------------------------

The boot process occurs in two steps using an initial RAM disk (*initrd* for
short). This is composed of an archive with further drivers and programs.

The GRUB boot manager (see :ref:`grub`) loads the kernel and the *initrd* into
the system memory, where the *initrd* archive is extracted and mounted as a
temporary root file system. The real root file system is then mounted from this,
before the temporary archive is removed and the system start implemented.

The drivers to be used are recognized automatically during system start and
loaded via the :program:`udev` device manager. At this point, the necessary
device links are also created under :file:`/dev/`. If drivers are not recognized
(which can occur if no respective hardware IDs are registered or hardware is
employed which cannot be recognized automatically, e.g., ISA boards), kernel
modules to be loaded can be added via |UCSUCRV| :envvar:`kernel/modules`. If
more than one kernel module is to be loaded, these must be separated by a
semicolon. The |UCSUCRV| :envvar:`kernel/blacklist` can be used to configure a
list of one or more kernel modules for which automatic loading should be
prevented. Multiple entries must also be separated by a semicolon.

Unlike other operating systems, the Linux kernel (with very few exceptions)
provides all drivers for hardware components from one source. For this reason,
it is not normally necessary to install drivers from external sources
subsequently.

However, if external drivers or kernel modules are required, they can be
integrated via the DKMS framework (Dynamic Kernel Module Support). This provides
a standardized interface for kernel sources, which are then built automatically
for every installed kernel (insofar as the source package is compatible with the
respective kernel). For this to happen, the kernel header package
:program:`linux-headers-amd64` must be installed in addition to the
:program:`dkms` package. Please note that not all the external kernel modules
are compatible with all kernels.

.. _grub:

GRUB boot manager
-----------------

In |UCSUCS| GNU GRUB 2 is used as the boot manager. GRUB provides a menu which
allows the selection of a Linux kernel or another operating system to be booted.
GRUB can also access file systems directly and can thus, for example, load
another kernel in case of an error.

.. _grub-selection:

.. figure:: /images/computers_grub.*
   :alt: GRUB menu

   GRUB menu

GRUB gets loaded in a two-step procedure; in the Master Boot Record of the hard
drive, the Stage 1 loader is written which refers to the data of Stage 2, which
in turn manages the rest of the boot procedure.

The selection of kernels to be started in the boot menu is stored in the file
:file:`/boot/grub/grub.cfg`. This file is generated automatically; all installed
kernel packages are available for selection. The memory test program
:command:`Memtest86+` can be started by selecting the option :guilabel:`Memory
test` and performs a consistency check for the main memory.

There is a five second waiting period during which the kernel to be booted can
be selected. This delay can be changed via the |UCSUCRV| :envvar:`grub/timeout`.

By default a screen size of ``800x600`` pixels and 16 Bit color depth is preset.
A different value can be set via the |UCSUCRV| :envvar:`grub/gfxmode`. Only
resolutions are supported which can be set via VESA BIOS extensions. A list of
available modes can be found in `VESA BIOS Extensions
<w-vesa-bios-extensions_>`_. The input must be specified in the format
:samp:`{HORIZONTAL}x{VERTICAL}@{COLOURDEPTHBIT}`, so for example
``1024x768@16``.

Kernel options for the started Linux kernel can be passed with the |UCSUCRV|
:envvar:`grub/append`. |UCSUCRV| :envvar:`grub/xenhopt` can be used to pass
options to the Xen hypervisor.

The graphic representation of the boot procedure - the so-called splash screen -
can be deactivated by setting |UCSUCRV| :envvar:`grub/bootsplash` to
``nosplash``.

.. _hardware-network-configuration:

Network configuration
---------------------

The configuration of network interfaces can be adjusted with the UMC module
:guilabel:`Network settings`.

The configuration is saved in |UCSUCR| variables, which can also be set
directly. These variables are listed in the individual sections.

.. _network-settings:

.. figure:: /images/computers_network.*
   :alt: Configuring the network settings

   Configuring the network settings

All the network cards available in the system are listed under *IPv4 network
devices* and *IPv6 network devices* (only network interfaces in the
:samp:`eth{X}` scheme are shown).

Network interfaces can be configured for IPv4 and/or IPv6. IPv4 addresses have a
32-bit length and are generally written in four blocks in decimal form (e.g.,
``192.0.2.10``), whereas IPv6 addresses are four times as long and typically
written in hexadecimal form (e.g., ``2001:0DB8:FE29:DE27:0000:0000:0000:0000``).

.. _computers-ipv4:

Configuration of IPv4 addresses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the *Dynamic (DHCP)* option was not chosen, the IP address to be bound to the
network card must be entered. In addition to the *IPv4 address* the *net mask*
must also be entered. *DHCP query* is used to request an address from a DHCP
server. Unless the *Dynamic (DHCP)* option is activated, the values received
from the DHCP request are configured statically.

Server systems can also be configured via DHCP. This is necessary for some cloud
providers, for example. If the assignment of an IP address for a server fails, a
random link local address (:samp:`169.254.{x}.{y}`) is configured as a
replacement.

For UCS server systems the address received via DHCP is also written to the LDAP
directory.

.. note::

   Not all services (e.g., DNS servers) are suitable for use on a DHCP-based
   server.

UCR variables:

* :envvar:`interfaces/ethX/address`
* :envvar:`interfaces/ethX/netmask`
* :envvar:`interfaces/ethX/type`
* :envvar:`gateway`

Besides the physical interfaces, additional virtual interfaces can also be
defined in the form :envvar:`interfaces/ethX_Y/setting`.

.. _computers-ipv6:

Configuration of IPv6 addresses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The IPv6 address can be configured in two ways: Stateless address
autoconfiguration (SLAAC) is employed in the :guilabel:`Autoconfiguration
(SLAAC)` configuration. In this, the IP address is assigned from the routers of
the local network segment. Alternatively, the address can also be configured
statically by entering the *IPv6 address* and *IPv6 prefix*.

In contrast to DHCP, in SLAAC there is no assignment of additional data such as
the DNS server to be used. There is an additional protocol for this (DHCPv6),
which, however, is not employed in the dynamic assignment. One network card can
be used for different IPv6 addresses. The *Identifier* is a unique name for
individual addresses. The main address always uses the identifier ``default``;
functional identifiers such as ``Interface mail server`` can be assigned for all
other addresses.

UCR variables:

* :envvar:`interfaces/ethX/ipv6/address`
* :envvar:`interfaces/ethX/ipv6/prefix`,
* :envvar:`interfaces/ethX/ipv6/acceptRA` activates SLAAC

Further network settings can be performed under :guilabel:`Global network
settings`.

The IP addresses for the standard gateways in the subnetwork can be entered
under *Gateway (IPv4)* and *Gateway (IPv6)*. It is not obligatory to enter a
gateway for IPv6, but recommended. A gateway configured here has preference over
router advertisements, which might otherwise be able to change the route.

UCR variables:

* :envvar:`ipv6/gateway`

.. _computers-configuring-the-name-servers:

Configuring the name servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two types of DNS servers:

External DNS Server
   An *External DNS Server* is employed for the resolution of host names and
   addresses outside of the UCS domain, e.g., ``univention.de``. This is
   typically a name server operated by the internet provider.

Domain DNS Server
   A *Domain DNS Server* is a local name server in the UCS domain. This name
   server usually administrates host names and IP addresses belonging to the UCS
   domain. If an address is not found in the local inventory, an external DNS
   server is automatically requested. The DNS data are saved in the LDAP
   directory service, i.e., all domain DNS servers deliver identical data.

A local DNS server is set up on the |UCSPRIMARYDN|, |UCSBACKUPDN| and
|UCSREPLICADN| system roles. Here, you can configure which server should be
primarily used for the name resolution by entering the *Domain DNS
Server*.

UCR variables:

* :envvar:`nameserver1` to :envvar:`nameserver3`
* :envvar:`dns/forwarder1` to :envvar:`dns/forwarder3`,

.. _computers-network-complex:

Bridges, bonding, VLANs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

UCS supports advanced network configurations using bridging, bonding and virtual
networks (VLAN):

* Bridging is often used with virtualization to connect multiple virtual
  machines running on a host through one shared physical network interface.

* Bonding allows failover redundancy for hosts with multiple physical network
  interfaces to the same network.

* VLANs can be used to separate network traffic logically while using only one
  (or more) physical network interface.

.. _computers-network-complex-bridge:

Configure bridging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. index::
   single: network; bridge
   single: network; switch
   pair: bridge; network

The most common application scenario for *bridging* is the shared use of a
physical network card by one or more virtual machines. Instead of one network
card for each virtual machine and the virtualization server itself, all systems
are connected via a shared uplink. A bridge can be compared with a switch
implemented in software which is used to connect the individual hosts together.
The hardware network adapter used is called a *bridge port*.

In order to configure a bridge, ``Bridge`` must be selected as the *Interface
type* under :guilabel:`Add`. The *Name of new bridge interface* can be selected
at will. Then click on :guilabel:`Next`.

The physical network card intended to act as the uplink can be selected under
*Bridge ports*. In the typical scenario of connecting virtual machines
via just one network card, there is no risk of a network loop. If the bridge is
used to connect two Ethernet networks, the spanning tree protocol (STP) is
employed to avoid network loops. The Linux kernel only implements STP, not the
Rapid STP or Multiple STP versions.

The *Forwarding delay* setting configures the waiting time in seconds during
which information is collected about the network topology when a connection is
being made via STP. If the bridge is used for connecting virtual machines to one
physical network card, STP should be disabled by setting the value to ``0``.
Otherwise problems may occur when using DHCP, as the packets sent during the
waiting time are not forwarded.

The *Additional bridge options* input field can be used to configure arbitrary
bridge parameters. This is only necessary in exceptional cases; an overview of
the possible settings can be found on the manual page
:manpage:`bridge-utils-interfaces(5)`.

Clicking on :guilabel:`Next` offers the possibility of optionally assigning the
bridge an IP address. This interface can then also be used as a network
interface for the virtualization host. The options are the same as described in
:ref:`computers-ipv4` and :ref:`computers-ipv6`.

.. _computers-network-complex-bonding:

Configure bonding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. index::
   single: network; bonding
   single: network; link aggregation
   pair: bonding; network
   single: network; etherchannel
   single: network; teaming
   single: network; trunking


*Bonding* can be used to bundle two (or more) physical network cards in order to
increase the performance or improve redundancy in failover scenarios.

In order to configure a bonding, ``Bonding`` must be selected as the *Interface
type* under :guilabel:`Add`. The *Name of the bonding interface* can be selected
at will. Then click on :guilabel:`Next`.

The network cards which form part of the bonding interface are selected under
*Bond slaves*. The network cards which should be given preference in failover
scenarios (see below) can be selected via *Bond primary*.

The *Mode* configures the distribution of the network cards within the bonding:

* ``balance-rr (0)`` distributes the packets equally over the available network
  interfaces within the bonding one after the other. This increases performance
  and improves redundancy. In order to use this mode, the network switches used
  must support *link aggregation*.

* When ``active-backup (1)`` is used, only one network card is active for each
  bonding interface (by default this is the network interface configured in
  *Bond primary*). If the primary network card fails, this is detected by the
  Linux kernel, which switches to another card in the bonding. This version
  increases redundancy. It can be used with every network switch.

In addition, there are also a number of other bonding methods. These are
generally only relevant for special cases and are described under `Linux
Ethernet Bonding Driver HOWTO <kernel-bonding_>`_.

The Media Independent Interface (MII) of the network cards is used to detect
failed network adapters. The *MII link monitoring frequency* setting
specifies the testing interval in milliseconds.

All other bonding parameters can be configured under *Additional bonding
options*. This is only necessary in exceptional cases; an overview of the
possible settings can be found under `Linux Ethernet Bonding Driver HOWTO
<kernel-bonding_>`_.

Clicking on :guilabel:`Next` allows to optionally assign the bonding interface
an IP address. If one of the existing network cards which form part of the
bonding interface has already been assigned an IP address, this configuration
will be removed. The options are the same as described in :ref:`computers-ipv4`
and :ref:`computers-ipv6`.

.. _computers-network-complex-vlan:

Configure VLAN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. index::
   pair: network; vlan
   single: network; 802.1q

VLANs can be used to separate the network traffic in a physical network
logically over one or more virtual subnetworks. Each of these virtual networks
is an independent broadcast domain. This makes it e.g. possible to differentiate
between a network for the employees and a guest network for visitors in a
company network although they use the same physical cables. The individual end
devices can be assigned to the VLANs via the configuration of the switches. The
network switches must support 802.1q VLANs.

A distinction is made between two types of connections between network cards:

* A connection only transports packets from a specific VLAN. In this case,
  untagged data packets are transmitted.

  This is typically the case if only one individual end device is connected via
  this network connection.

* A connection transports packets from several VLANs. This is also referred to
  as a trunk link. In this case, each packet is assigned to a VLAN using a VLAN
  ID. During transmission between trunk links and specific VLANs, the network
  switch takes over the task of filtering the packets by means of the VLAN IDs
  as well as adding and removing the VLAN IDs.

  This type of connection is primarily used between switches/servers.

  Some switches also allow the sending of packets with and without VLAN tags
  over a shared connection, but this is not described in more detail here.

When configuring a VLAN in the UMC module :guilabel:`Network settings` it is
possible to configure for a computer which VLANs it wants to participate in. An
example here would be an internal company web server, which should be available
both to the employees and any users of the guest network.

In order to configure a VLAN, ``Virtual LAN`` must be selected as the *Interface
type* under :guilabel:`Add`. The network interface for which the VLAN is
specified with *Parent interface*. The *VLAN ID* is the unique identifier of the
VLAN. Valid values are from 1 to 4095. Then :guilabel:`Next` must be clicked.

Clicking on :guilabel:`Next` allows to optionally assign the VLAN interface an
IP address. The options are the same as described in :ref:`computers-ipv4` and
:ref:`computers-ipv6`. When assigning an IP address, ensure that the address
matches the assigned VLAN address range.

.. _computers-configuring-proxy-access:

Proxy access configuration
--------------------------

The majority of the command line tools which access web servers (e.g.,
:command:`wget`, :command:`elinks` or :command:`curl`) check whether the
environment variables :envvar:`http_proxy` or :envvar:`https_proxy` are set. If this is the case, the proxy
server set in these variables is used automatically.

The |UCSUCRV| :envvar:`proxy/http` and :envvar:`proxy/https` can also be used to activate the setting of
these environment variables through an entry in :file:`/etc/profile`.

The proxy URL must be specified for this, for example :samp:`http://192.0.2.100`. The
proxy port can be specified in the proxy URL using a colon, for example
:samp:`http://192.0.2.100:3128`. If the proxy requires authentication,
this can be provided in the form :samp:`http://{username}:{password}@192.0.2.100`.

The environment variable is not adopted for sessions currently opened. A new login
is required for the change to be activated.

The Univention tools for software updates also support operation via a proxy and
query the |UCSUCR| variable.

Individual domains can be excluded from use by the proxy by including them
separated by commas in the |UCSUCRV| :envvar:`proxy/no_proxy`. Subdomains are
taken into account; e.g. an exception for ``software-univention.de`` also
applies for ``updates.software-univention.de``.

.. _computers-mounting-nfs-shares:

Mounting NFS shares
-------------------

The *NFS mounts* policy of the UMC computer management can be used to
configure NFS shares, which are mounted on the system. There is a *NFS
share* for selection, which is mounted in the file path specified under
*Mount point*.

.. _nfs-mount:

.. figure:: /images/computers_policy_nfsshare.*
   :alt: Mounting a NFS share

   Mounting a NFS share

.. _computers-hardware-sysinfo:

Collection of list of supported hardware
----------------------------------------

Univention collects information about hardware which is compatible with UCS and
in use by customers. The information processed for this is gathered by the UMC
module :guilabel:`Hardware information`.

All files are forwarded to Univention anonymously and only transferred once
permission has been received from the user.

The start dialogue contains the entry fields *Manufacturer* and *Model*, which
must be completed with the values determined from the DMI information of the
hardware. The fields can also be adapted and an additional
*Descriptive comment* added.

If the hardware information is transferred as part of a support request, the
:guilabel:`This is related to a support case` option should be activated. A
ticket number can be entered in the next field; this facilitates assignment and
allows quicker processing.

Clicking on :guilabel:`Next` offers an overview of the transferred hardware
information. In addition, a compressed TAR archive is created, which contains a
list of the hardware components used in the system and can be downloaded via
:guilabel:`Archive with system information`.

Clicking on :guilabel:`Next` again allows you to select the way the data are
transferred to Univention. :guilabel:`Upload` transmits the data via HTTPS,
:guilabel:`Send mail)` opens a dialogue, which lists the needed steps to send
the archive via email.
