Specification of an update point using the package maintenance policy
=====================================================================

A *Maintenance* policy (see :ref:`central-policies`) in the UMC modules for
computer and domain management can be used to specify a point at which the
following steps should be performed:

* Check for available release updates to be installed (see
  :ref:`computers-softwaremanagement-release-policy`) and, if applicable,
  installation.

* Installation/deinstallation of package lists (see
  :ref:`computers-softwaremanagement-package-lists`)

* Installation of available errata updates

Alternatively, the updates can also be performed when the system is booting or
shut down.
