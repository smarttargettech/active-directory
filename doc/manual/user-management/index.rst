User management
***************

.. highlight:: console

UCS integrates central identity management. All user information are managed
centrally in UCS via the |UCSUMC| module :guilabel:`Users` and stored in the
LDAP directory service.

.. note::

   The user management is part of Univention Nubus in the *Directory Manager* component.
   For more information about Nubus, refer to :ref:`introduction-nubus`

All the services integrated in the domain access the central account
information, i.e., the same username and password are used for the user login to
a Windows client as for the login on the IMAP server.

The domain-wide management of user data reduces the administrative efforts as
changes do not need to be subsequently configured on different individual
systems. Moreover, this also avoids subsequent errors arising from
inconsistencies between the individual datasets.

.. _users-types:

.. rubric:: User account types

There are three different types of user accounts in UCS:

1. **Normal user accounts** have all available properties. These users can log
   in to UCS or Windows systems and, depending on the configuration, also to the
   installed Apps. The users can be administered via the UMC module
   :guilabel:`Users` (see :ref:`users-management`).

2. **Address book entries** can be used to maintain internal or external contact
   information. These contacts can't sign in to UCS or Windows systems.
   Address book entries can be managed via the UMC module :guilabel:`Contacts`.

3. **Simple authentication account**: With a simple authentication account, a
   user object is created, which has only a username and a password. With this
   account, only authentication against the LDAP directory service is possible,
   but no login to UCS or Windows systems. Simple authentication accounts can be
   accessed via the UMC module :guilabel:`LDAP directory` (see
   :ref:`central-navigation`).

.. _users-recommendation-usernames:

.. rubric:: Recommendation for username definition

One very important and required attribute for user accounts is the *username*. To
avoid conflicts with the different tools handling user accounts in UCS, adhere
to the following recommendations for the definition of usernames:

* Only use lower case letters (``a-z``), digits (``0-9``) and the hyphen (``-``)
  from the ASCII character set for usernames.

* The username starts with a lower case letter from the ASCII character set. The
  hyphen is not allowed as last character.

* In UCS the username has at least a length of 4 characters and at most 20
  characters.

The recommendation results in the following regular expression:
:regexp:`^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{2,18}[a-z0-9]$`.

Besides the recommendation, usernames also contain underscores (``_``) and upper
case ASCII letters in practice. Consider the recommendation as a guideline and
not a rule and keep potential side-effects in mind when defining usernames
outside the recommendation.
