User management through |UCSUMC| module
=======================================

This section describes the user management through the UMC module *Users*.

.. _users-management-user-creation-wizard:

User creation wizard
--------------------

To create users, administrators can use the simplified user creation wizard,
as shown in the following screenshots.

You open the wizard by clicking the :guilabel:`Add` button in the *Users* module.
In the first page *Add a new user*,
you select the *Container* where you want to locate the user object
and if you want to create a user account using a template.

When you click :guilabel:`Next`, you see the page in :numref:`user-create`.

.. _user-create:

.. figure:: /images/users_user.*
   :alt: Creating a user in the UMC module 'Users'

   Creating a user in the UMC module *Users*

With :guilabel:`Next`, the *Users* module shows the third page as in
:numref:`user-password`, where you can define the initial password.

.. _user-password:

.. figure:: /images/users_password.*
   :alt: Password setting for a user

   Password setting for a user

As an alternative the user may set the initial password themselves,
if the UCS domain has the :program:`Self Service` app installed.
To allow the user setting the initial password by themselves,
you must define their external email address.

To define an external email address,
open the *Advanced* user account settings,
click the tab :guilabel:`Contact` and provide an external email address in the field *E-mail address*.
The self service app sends an email to the user's external email address with a link and a token.
The user can use the link to set their initial password and unlock the user account.
For more information, refer to :ref:`user-management-password-changes-by-users-self-service`.

.. _user-password-new:

.. figure:: /images/users_self-service.*
   :alt: Initial user password

By default, the *Users* module shows a simplified wizard for creating a user.
The wizard only requests the most important settings.
To see all user account attributes as in :numref:`user-create-advanced`,
click :guilabel:`Advanced` in the wizard.

You can deactivate the simplified wizard by setting the
|UCSUCRV| :envvar:`directory/manager/web/modules/users/user/wizard/disabled` to
``true`` and restarting the :program:`univention-management-console-server`.

.. _user-create-advanced:

.. figure:: /images/users_user_advanced.*
   :alt: Advanced user settings

   Advanced user settings

If you want to define the user's primary email address in the simplified wizard,
you can activate the field by setting the
|UCSUCRV| :envvar:`directory/manager/web/modules/users/user/properties/mailPrimaryAddress/required` to
``true`` and restarting the :program:`univention-management-console-server`.
The wizard's second page then asks for the user's primary email address,
as shown in :numref:`user-create-wizard-primary-email`.

.. _users-management-table-general:

User management module - General tab
------------------------------------

.. _users-management-table-general-tab:

.. list-table:: *General* tab
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Attribute
     - Description

   * - Title
     - The title of the user is to be entered here.

   * - First name
     - The first name of the user is to be entered here.

   * - Last name
     - The last name of the user is to be entered here.

   * - Username
     - This is the name, by which the user logs into the system. For recommended
       characters for the user, see :ref:`users-recommendation-usernames`.

       In order to ensure compatibility to non-UCS systems the creation of users
       which are only distinguished from each other by upper and lower case
       letters is prevented. Thus, if the username ``smith`` already exists,
       then the username ``Smith`` cannot be created.

       By default it is not possible to create a user with the same name as an
       existing group. If the |UCSUCRV|
       :envvar:`directory/manager/user_group/uniqueness` is set to ``false``,
       this check is removed.

   * - Description
     - Arbitrary descriptions for the user can be entered here.

   * - Password
     - The user's password has to be entered here.

   * - Password (retype)
     - In order to avoid spelling errors, the user's password has to be entered
       for a second time.

   * - Override password history
     - By checking this box, the password history is overridden for this user
       and for this password change. This means, with this change the user can
       be assigned a password which is already in use.

       Further details on user password management can be found in
       :ref:`users-passwords`.

   * - Override password check
     - By checking this box, the requirements for the length of the password and
       for password quality checks are overridden for this user and for this
       password change. This means, the user can e.g. be assigned a shorter
       password than would be possible according to the defined minimum length.

       Further details on the password policies for users can be found in
       :ref:`users-passwords`.

   * - Primary email address (mailbox)
     - The email address of the user is declared here, see
       :ref:`mail-management-users`.

   * - Display name
     - The display name is automatically composed of the first and surnames. It
       generally does not need to be changed. The screen name is used for the
       synchronization with Active Directory and Samba/AD among other things.

   * - Birthday
     - This field is used to save a user's birthday.

   * - Organization
     - The organization is to be entered here.

   * - Employee number
     - Numbers for staff members can be entered in this field.

   * - Employee type
     - The category of the staff member can be entered here.

   * - Superior
     - The superior of the user can be selected here.

   * - Picture of the user (JPEG format)
     - This mask can be used to save a picture of the user in LDAP in JPEG
       format. In the default settings the file size is limited to 512
       kilobytes.

.. _users-management-table-groups:

User management module - Groups tab
-----------------------------------

.. _users-management-table-groups-tab:

.. list-table:: *Groups* tab
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Attribute
     - Description

   * - Primary group
     - This selection list can be used for specifying the user's primary group.
       All the groups registered in the domain are open for selection. By
       default, the group ``Domain Users`` is preset.

   * - Groups
     - Here it is possible to set further group memberships for the user in
       addition to the primary group.

.. _users-management-table-account:

User management module - Account tab
------------------------------------

.. _users-management-table-account-tab:

.. list-table:: *Account* tab
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Attribute
     - Description

   * - Account is deactivated
     - The *Account is deactivated* checkbox can be used to deactivate the user
       account. If the checkbox is selected, the user cannot log into the system. This
       affects all authentication methods. This is typically used when a user
       leaves the company. In a heterogeneous environment, an account
       deactivation might also be caused by external tools.

   * - Account expiry date
     - A date is specified in this input field on which the account will
       automatically be locked. This is practical for user accounts that only
       need to be active for a certain period of time, e.g., for interns.

       If the date is deleted or replaced by a different, future date, the user
       will regain the right to sign in.

   * - User has to change password on next login
     - If this checkbox is ticked, then the user has to change their password
       during the next login procedure.

   * - Password expiry date
     - If the password is subject to an expiry date, then this date is displayed
       in this entry field. This entry field cannot be edited directly, see
       :ref:`users-passwords`.

       If a password expiry interval is defined, the password expiry date is
       automatically adjusted when passwords are changed.

       If no *Expiry interval* is declared, the old expiry date will be deleted
       and no new date will be set.

   * - Unlock lockout
     - If the account has automatically been locked temporarily for security
       reasons, usually because the user has entered the password incorrectly
       too often, this checkbox can be used to unlock the account again manually
       before the lockout is lifted automatically when the lockout duration has
       passed. This temporary account lockout can happen if a corresponding
       domain wide policy setting has been defined by an administrator. There
       are three different mechanisms that may trigger lockout if configured
       properly:

       * Failed PAM authentication attempts to an UCS server (see
         :ref:`users-faillog`).

       * Failed LDAP authentication attempts (if the :program:`ppolicy` overlay
         has been activated and configured).

       * Failed Samba/AD authentication attempts (if the Samba domain
         ``passwordsettings`` have been configured).

   * - Lockout till
     - If the account has automatically been locked temporarily for security
       reasons, usually because the user has entered the password incorrectly
       too often, this field shows the time when the account automatically gets
       unlocked.

   * - Activation date
     - If a user account shall only become usable at a later date, this can be
       set here. A cron job periodically checks if accounts need to be
       activated. It runs every 15 minutes by default. When saving the changes,
       the account is automatically marked as deactivated in case a date in the
       future has been specified.

   * - Windows home drive
     - If the Windows home directory for this user is to show up on a different
       Windows drive than that specified by the Samba configuration, then the
       corresponding drive letter can be entered here, e.g. :file:`M:`.

   * - Windows home path
     - The path of the directory which is to be the user's Windows home
       directory, is to be entered here, e.g. :file:`\\ucs-file-server\smith`.

   * - Windows logon script
     - The user-specific logon script relative to the NETLOGON share is entered
       here, e.g. :file:`user.bat`.

   * - Windows profile directory
     - The profile directory for the user can be entered here, e.g.
       :file:`\\ucs-file-server\user\profile`.

   * - Relative ID
     - The relative ID (RID) is the local part of the SID. If a user is to be
       assigned a certain RID, the ID in question can be entered in this field.
       If no RID is assigned, the next available RID will automatically be used.
       The RID cannot be subsequently changed. Integers from 1000 upwards are
       permitted. RIDs below 1000 are reserved to standard groups and other
       special objects.

   * - Samba privilege(s)
     - This selection mask can be used to assign a user selected Windows systems
       rights, for example the permission to join a system to the domain.

   * - Permitted times for Windows logins
     - This input field contains time periods for which this user can sign in to
       Windows computers.

       If no entry is made in this field, the user can sign in at any time of
       day.

   * - Allow the authentication only on these Microsoft Windows host(s)
     - This setting specifies the clients where the user may sign in. If no
       settings are made, the user can sign in to any client.

   * - UNIX home directory
     - The path of the user's home directory.

   * - Login shell
     - The user's login shell is to be entered in this field. This program is
       started if the user performs a text-based login. By default,
       :file:`/bin/bash` is preset.

   * - User ID
     - If the user is to be assigned a certain user ID, the ID in question can
       be entered in this field. If no value is specified, a free user ID is
       assigned automatically.

       The user ID can only be declared when adding the user. When the user data
       are subsequently edited, the user ID will be represented in gray and
       barred from change.

   * - Group ID of the primary group
     - The group ID of the user's primary group is shown here. The primary group
       can be changed in the *General* tab.

   * - Home share
     - If a share is selected here, the home directory is stored on the
       specified server. If no selection is made, the user data are saved on
       the respective login system.

   * - Home share path
     - The path of the home directory relative to the *Home share* is declared
       here. The username is already preset as a default value when creating a
       user.

   * - Email address(es)
     - Additional email addresses can be saved here. These are not evaluated by
       the mail server.

       The values of this attribute are stored in the LDAP attribute ``mail``.
       Most address book applications using an LDAP search function will search
       for an email address by this attribute.

     - This field contains the user's business phone number.

   * - Room number(s)
     - The room number of the user.
