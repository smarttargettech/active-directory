Monitoring
==========

.. versionadded:: 5.0-2
   UCS 5.0-2 supports monitoring alerts through *Prometheus* metrics.

With *Prometheus*, *Prometheus Node Exporter*, and *Prometheus Alertmanager*,
administrators can verify the correct function of complex IT structures from networks,
computers and services continually and automatically.

Prometheus Node Exporter exports a comprehensive collection of metrics into the
Prometheus database. Besides polling system indicators like CPU, memory usage,
and free disk space, they test availability and operation of different services
like SSH, SMTP, and HTTP. Operation tests generally perform program steps such
as the delivery of a test email or the resolution of a DNS record. The
Prometheus Node Exporter provides UCS specific alerts in addition to the start
metrics already included, for example an alert for the listener/notifier
replication.

When the operating status changes, the monitoring informs a contact
person specified in advance of the possible malfunction.
In addition to the reactive notification in case of error, administrators
can check the current status at any time continually in the
*Grafana UCS Dashboard* web interface displaying the status information
in a compact manner.

   :alt: Alert dashboard

   Alert dashboard

See UCS-Dashboard :ref:`dashboard-installation` for an overview of all involved components.

Administrators define the alert configuration in |UCSUMC|.
A listener module automatically generates the configuration files from
information stored in the LDAP directory.


.. _monitoring-installation:

Installation
------------

For installation of the UCS Dashboard components, see :ref:`dashboard-installation`.

Additionally to the components of the UCS Dashboard you need to install the
*Prometheus Alertmanager* app and the *univention-monitoring-client*.

For every UCS system that the administrator wants to show system data on the
dashboard, they must install the *UCS Dashboard Client* app. The package
:program:`univention-monitoring-client` depends on the *UCS Dashboard Client*
app and is installed on every UCS system by default for the alert functionality.

Prometheus Alertmanager
   The *Prometheus Alertmanager* app to send notifications for example through email
   for firing alerts. The Alertmanager needs some configuration to work properly.

.. figure:: /images/alertmanager-appsettings.*
    :alt: Alertmanager Settings

The settings include the recipients of the email alert notifications.
Furthermore, the app settings need a value for a SMTP server to send email
notifications. The Alertmanager supports the SMTP authentication methods
``PLAIN``, ``LOGIN``, and ``CRAM-MD5`` as well as communication with TLS. No
authentication will be used, if you leave all authentication related fields of
the app settings empty.

:program:`univention-monitoring-client`
   The package :program:`univention-monitoring-client` provides standard alert
   plugins for checking the system health.

Administrators can install plugins with the following packages, that add alerts
beyond the standard plugins provided with the
:program:`univention-monitoring-client` package:

* :program:`univention-monitoring-raid`: Monitoring of the software RAID status

* :program:`univention-monitoring-smart`: Test of the S.M.A.R.T. status of hard
  drives

* :program:`univention-monitoring-opsi`: Test of software distribution OPSI

* :program:`univention-monitoring-cups`: Test of CUPS printing system

* :program:`univention-monitoring-squid`: Test of Squid proxy server

* :program:`univention-monitoring-samba`: Test of the Samba 4 services

* :program:`univention-monitoring-s4-connector`: Test of the S4 Connector

* :program:`univention-monitoring-ad-connector`: Test of the AD Connector

Some services already automatically setup their respective package
during installation. For example, if administrators setup the
:program:`UCS AD Connector`, it automatically includes the
monitoring plugin.

.. _monitoring-preconfigured-checks:

Preconfigured monitoring checks
-------------------------------

The installation automatically sets up basic monitoring tests for UCS systems.
All alerts have label *severity* with value ``critical`` or ``warning``.

.. list-table:: Preconfigured alerts
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 4 8

   * - Alert
     - Description

   * - ``UNIVENTION_DISK_ROOT`` and ``UNIVENTION_DISK_ROOT_WARNING``

       if the remaining free space falls below 25% or 10% by default.

   * - ``UNIVENTION_DNS``
     - Tests the function of the local DNS server and the accessibility of the
       public DNS server by querying the hostname ``www.univention.de``. If no
       DNS forwarder is defined for the UCS domain, this request fails. In this
       case, ``www.univention.de`` can be replaced with the FQDN of the
       |UCSPRIMARYDN| for example, in the :envvar:`monitoring/dns/lookup-domain`
       to test the function of the name resolution.

   * - ``UNIVENTION_LDAP_AUTH``
     - Monitors the LDAP server running on UCS Directory Nodes.

   * - ``UNIVENTION_LOAD`` and ``UNIVENTION_LOAD_WARNING``
     - Monitors the system load.

   * - ``UNIVENTION_NTP`` and ``UNIVENTION_NTP_WARNING``
     - Requests the time from the NTP service on the monitored UCS system. If
       this deviates by more than ``60`` or ``120`` seconds, the error status is
       attained.

   * - ``UNIVENTION_SMTP``
     - Tests if the SMTP server is reachable. The alert fires if it is not reachable.

   * - ``UNIVENTION_SSL`` and ``UNIVENTION_SSL_WARNING``

     - Monitors the status of the LDAP replication and recognizes the creation
       of a :file:`failed.ldif` file and the standstill of the replication and
       warns of large differences between the transaction IDs.


   * - ``UNIVENTION_NSCD`` and ``UNIVENTION_NSCD2``
     - Tests the availability of the name server cache daemon (NSCD). If there
       is no NSCD process running, a *critical* alert is fired; if more than
       one process is running, a *warning* alert is fired.

   * - ``UNIVENTION_WINBIND``
     - Tests the availability of the Winbind service. If no process is running,
       a *critical* alert is fired.

       NetBIOS service in Samba. If no process is running, an alert is fired.

   * - ``UNIVENTION_JOINSTATUS`` and ``UNIVENTION_JOINSTATUS_WARNING``
     - Tests the join status of a system. If a system has yet to join, a *critical*
       alert is fired; if non-run join scripts are available, a *warning* alert is fired.

   * - ``UNIVENTION_KPASSWDD``
     - Tests the availability of the Kerberos password service (only available
       on Primary/|UCSBACKUPDN|\ s). If fewer or more than one process is running,
       an alert is fired.

   * - ``UNIVENTION_PACKAGE_STATUS``
     - Monitors the status of installed debian packages. If any package has status *half-installed*
       an alert is fired.

   * - ``UNIVENTION_SLAPD_MDB_MAXSIZE`` and ``UNIVENTION_SLAPD_MDB_MAXSIZE_WARNING``

   * - ``UNIVENTION_SAMBA_REPLICATION``
     - Monitors the status of the samba replication. the alert is fired if any replication failures are present.
.. _monitoring-configuration:

Configuration
-------------

|UCSUMC| offers the following settings:

* Administrators must configure the alert
  (see :ref:`Monitoring installation <monitoring-installation>`) and define on
  which computers of the domain an alert shall be
  active (see :ref:`monitoring-assign-alerts`).

* To configure the contact person that the *Alertmanager* notifies in case of
  errors or alerts, set the appropriate app setting in the :program:`Prometheus
  Alertmanager` app
  (see :ref:`Monitoring installation <monitoring-installation>`).

* Administrators can silence firing alerts for a defined time. See the
  `Prometheus Alertmanager documentation
  <https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/#silences>`_.
  Use the *Prometheus Alertmanager* web interface for those settings.

The basic settings already define a large number of tests for each computer, for
example an alert basic configuration without the need for any further
adjustments.

.. _monitoring-alert-configuration:

Configure monitoring alerts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An alert defines the monitoring of a service or a status, for example free disk
space. Administrators can assign any number of computers to such an alert
object.

Administrators manage monitoring alerts in the UMC module :guilabel:`Monitoring`
with the object type *Alert*, see
:ref:`computers-management-table-monitoring-alert`. Prometheus has no LDAP
interface for the monitoring configuration. Instead, a listener module generates
the configuration files when administrators add, edit, or remove alerts.

.. list-table:: *General* tab
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 4 8

   * - Attribute
     - Description

   * - ``Name``
     - An unambiguous name for the alert.

   * - ``Alert group``
     - Defines the group that includes the alert. Multiple alarms can belong to
       the same group.

   * - ``Query expression``
     - Prometheus query expression, which triggers the alert. The alert triggers
       when the given query returns a non-empty vector.

       For details about the syntax, see the `Prometheus documentation
       <prometheus-query-expression_>`_.

   * - ``For clause``
     - Defines the time that the query expression result is non-empty until the
       alert triggers.

   * - ``Summary template``
     - The title of the alert, shown in alert dashboard and alert email
       notifications.

   * - ``Description template``
     - The description of the alert, shown in alert dashboard and alert email
       notifications.

   * - ``Labels``
     - *Prometheus* attaches labels to alerts. Labels help in queries for
       alerts. For example: *severity* with the value ``critical`` or
       ``warning``.

   * - ``Template Values``
     - Query expressions, descriptions and summaries can use variable values.
       For example: Reference ``max`` through ``%max%``.

.. list-table:: *Hosts* tab
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 4 8

   * - Attribute
     - Description

   * - ``Assigned hosts``
     - *Prometheus* executes the query on the computers referenced here. The
       listener module runs the tests for the alert. It replaces the term
       ``%instance%`` in the query expression with a regular expression that
       matches the assigned hosts.

.. _monitoring-assign-alerts:

Assign monitoring alerts to computers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Prometheus* can monitor all computers administered with |UCSUMC|.

Navigate in the |UCSUMC| to :guilabel:`Computers` and choose the computer you want
to activate alerts on. Choose and add all alerts you like in the tab
*Advanced settings* under *Alerts* and save your changes.

     - Description

   * - ``Assigned monitoring alerts``
     - Lists all assigned monitoring alerts for the current computer. Add or
       remove alerts.

.. _monitoring-add-alerts:

Create new alerts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes how to add a custom script to collect new metrics and create new alerts.

As administrator, you can complement the preconfigured alerts supplied with UCS
with additional alerts. An alert check script exports metrics about the machine
it runs on to *Prometheus*. A *PromQL* query on metrics defines an alert in
*Prometheus*. For more information about how to write custom checks, see
`Querying basis <prometheus-query-expression_>`_.

Copy the custom alert check script into the directory
:file:`/usr/share/univention-monitoring-client/scripts/` on the UCS system that
shall export the custom metrics. Change the file mode to *executable* with
:command:`chmod a+x PLUGIN`.

All alert checks delivered by UCS use Python. Custom checks can use Perl,
Python, or Shell and don't require any external libraries or programs. All UCS
systems always provide the needed interpreters.

In contrast, if the custom alert check uses external programs or libraries,
ensure you install them on all UCS systems that use the custom alert check.

The alert check script exports one or multiple metrics by writing them to a text
file. It must write valid *Prometheus* metrics into a :file:`.prom` file in the
:file:`/var/lib/prometheus/node-exporter/` directory. *Prometheus* imports this
file.

You need to configure the custom alert in |UCSUMC|, see
:ref:`monitoring-alert-configuration`. You must enter a
Prometheus expression for the metric of the script to the *Query
expression* field. To assign the custom alert to UCS systems, see
:ref:`monitoring-assign-alerts`.
