************************************************
Identity Management connection to cloud services
************************************************

UCS offers an integrated Identity Management System. Through |UCSUMC|, users and
groups among others can be administered. Depending on the installed
services, these identities are made available through different interfaces e.g.
via LDAP.

The management system can be extended with the help of provided extensions, also
called apps. Thus users or groups can also be replicated in cloud services. In
the App Center there are also among others extensions for Microsoft 365 or G
Suite.

Thanks to single sign-on (SSO), users can sign in with their usual password and
immediately get to work online in the cloud. The password remains in the
company's network and is not transferred to the cloud service.

The following chapter describes how to set up the Microsoft 365 Connector and
the Google Apps for Work Connector.
