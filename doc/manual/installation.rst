Installation
************

The following documentation describes how to install Univention Corporate Server
(UCS). The UCS system is installed from the DVD. The installation is interactive
and prompts all the necessary system settings in a graphic interface.

The installation DVD is available for the computer architecture *amd64*
(64-bit). In addition to support for the widely distributed BIOS systems, the
DVD also includes support for the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI)
standard. The UEFI support on the DVD is also capable of starting systems with
activated Secure Boot and installing UCS there.

.. note::

   Please note that simultaneous operation of UCS and Debian on a UEFI
   system starting with UCS 5.0-0 is not supported. The reason for this
   is the GRUB boot loader of |UCSUCS|, which partly uses the same
   configuration files as Debian. An already installed Debian leads to
   the fact that UCS cannot be booted (any more) after the installation
   of or an update to UCS 5.0. A subsequent installation of Debian will
   also result in UCS 5.0 not being able to boot.

Following installation on hardware or in a virtualization solution, UCS can also
be installed on the Amazon EC2 cloud using an AMI image. Further information
can be found in :ref:`Installation in the Amazon EC2 cloud
<installation-amazon-ec2>`.

The installer's input masks can be operated with the mouse or via the keyboard.

* The :kbd:`Tab` key can be used to proceed to the next field.

* The key combination of :kbd:`Shift+Tab` can be used to return to the previous
  field.

* The :kbd:`Enter` key is used to assign values to the input field and confirm
  buttons.

* Within a list or table, the *arrow keys* can be used for navigating between
  entries.

.. note::

   The :guilabel:`Cancel` button can be used to cancel the current configuration
   step. An earlier configuration step can then be selected again in the menu
   that is subsequently shown. Under certain circumstances, subsequent
   configuration steps cannot be directly selected if the earlier steps have not
   been completed.

.. _installation-select-install-mode:

Selecting the installation mode
===============================

After booting the system from the installation medium, the following
boot prompt is displayed:

.. _installation-isolinux:

.. figure:: /images/installer-isolinux.*
   :alt: Installation boot prompt

   Installation boot prompt

Now you can choose between several installation procedures.

* :guilabel:`Start with default settings` starts the interactive, graphic
  installation. During the installation, the system requests a number of
  parameters such as the network settings, hard drive partitions and domain
  settings for the UCS system to be installed and then performs the installation
  and the configuration.

* :guilabel:`Start with manual network settings` performs a standard
  installation, where the network is not configured automatically through DHCP.
  This is practical on systems, where the network must be setup manually.

* The :guilabel:`Advanced options` submenu offers advanced options for the
  installation process for selection:

  * :guilabel:`Start in text mode` performs an interactive standard installation
    in text mode. This is practical on systems which display problems with the
    graphic version of the installer.

  * :guilabel:`Rescue mode` is there to recover systems unable
    to boot.

  * :guilabel:`Boot from first hard drive` boots the operating system installed
    on the first hard drive instead of the UCS installation.

* :guilabel:`Accessible dark contrast installer menu` allows to start the setup
  in a dark and contrast rich mode.

Once one of the installation option is selected, the kernel is loaded from the
installation medium. The actual installation is divided into separate modules,
which can be loaded from the installation medium subsequently if necessary.
There are modules for network configuration or for selecting the software to be
installed, among others.

.. _installation-select-installation-language:

Selecting the installation language
===================================

In the first step, you can select the system language you wish to use. The
selection has an influence on the use of language-specific characters and
permits the representation of program output in the selected languages in the
installed UCS system.

.. _installation-language-selection:

.. figure:: /images/installer-language.*
   :alt: Selecting the installation language

   Selecting the installation language

If Univention Installer has been translated into the selected language
(currently German and English), the selected language is also used during the
installation, otherwise the installation is performed in English.

.. _installation-select-location:

Selecting the location
======================

Once the system language has been selected, a small list of locations is
displayed based on the selected language. Select a suitable location from the
list. The selected location is used to set the time zone or the correct language
variant, for example. Should none of the displayed locations be appropriate, a
more extensive list can be displayed using the menu entry **other**.

.. _installation-location:

.. figure:: /images/installer-location.*
   :alt: Selecting the location

   Selecting the location

.. _installation-select-keyboard-layout:

Selecting the keyboard layout
=============================

The keyboard layout can be selected independently of the system language. The
language selected here should be compatible with the keyboard used as it may
otherwise cause operating problems.

.. _installation-keyboard-selection:

.. figure:: /images/installer-keyboardselection.*
   :alt: Selecting the keyboard layout

   Selecting the keyboard layout

.. _installation-network-configuration:

Network configuration
=====================

Initially, the Univention Installer attempts to configure the network interfaces
automatically. This can be disabled by selecting the menu item :guilabel:`Start
with manual network settings` from the menu of the boot loader. Firstly, an
attempt is made to determine an IPv6 address via the stateless address
autoconfiguration (SLAAC). If this is not successful, the Univention Installer
attempts to request an IPv4 address via the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
(DHCP). If this is successful, the manual network configuration of Univention
Installer is skipped.

.. _installation-netcfg-dhcp:

.. figure:: /images/installer-netcfg-dhcp.*
   :alt: Automatic network configuration

   Automatic network configuration

If there is no DHCP server present in the local network or static configuration
of the network interface is required, the :guilabel:`Cancel` button can be
selected. The Univention Installer then offers to repeat the automatic
configuration or to configure the interface manually.

.. note::

   At least one network interface is required for the installation of
   |UCSUCS|. If no supported network card is detected, Univention
   Installer opens a list of supported drivers for selection.

.. _installation-netcfg-static:

.. figure:: /images/installer-netcfg-static.*
   :alt: Selecting the manual network configuration

   Selecting the manual network configuration

In manual configuration it is possible to specify either a static IPv4 or an
IPv6 address for the system. IPv4 addresses have a 32-bit length and are
generally written in four blocks in decimal form (e.g., ``192.0.2.10``), whereas
IPv6 addresses are four times as long and typically written in hexadecimal form
(e.g., ``2001:0DB8:FE29:DE27:0000:0000:0000:0000``). In addition to entering a
static IP address, values for network masks, gateways and DNS servers are also
requested.

.. _installation-netcfg-ip:

.. figure:: /images/installer-netcfg-ip.*
   :alt: Specifying an IP address

   Specifying an IP address

The following points must be taken into consideration when specifying a DNS
server manually. They depend on the intended subsequent use of the UCS system.

* When installing the first UCS system in a new UCS domain, the IP address of
  the local router (if it provides the DNS service) or the DNS server of the
  internet provider should be entered.

* When installing every additional UCS system, the IP address of a UCS Directory
  Node system must be specified as the DNS server. This is essential for the
  automatic detection of the |UCSPRIMARYDN| to function. In case of doubt, the
  IP address of the UCS |UCSPRIMARYDN| system should be entered.

* If the UCS system is to join a Windows Active Directory domain during the
  installation, the IP address of an Active Directory domain controller system
  should be specified as the DNS server. This is essential for the automatic
  detection of the Windows Active Directory domain controller to function.

.. _installation-root-password:

Setting up the root password
============================

Setting of a password for the ``root`` user is required for logging on to the
installed system. If a |UCSPRIMARYDN| is installed, this password is also
employed for the ``Administrator`` user. In later operation, the passwords for
the ``root`` and ``Administrator`` users can be managed independently of each
other. The password must be re-entered in the second entry field.

The password must contain at least eight characters for security reasons.

.. _installation-password:

.. figure:: /images/installer-password.*
   :alt: Setting the root password

   Setting the root password

.. _installation-partition-hard-drive:

Partitioning the hard drive
===========================

The Univention Installer supports the partitioning of hard drives and the
creation of different file systems (e.g., *ext4* and *XFS*). In addition, it is
also possible to set up mechanisms such as the logical volume manager (LVM),
RAID or partitions encrypted with LUKS.

As of UCS 4.0, the Univention Installer selects a suitable partition model (MBR
or GPT) automatically depending on the size of the selected hard drive. On
systems with the *Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI)*, the GUID
Partition Table (GPT) is used automatically.

The Univention Installer offers guided installations to make installation
simpler. In the guided installation, certain standard schemes with respect to
the partitioning and formatting are applied to the selected hard drive. In
addition, it is also possible to perform partitioning manually.

There are three schemes available for selection for guided partitioning:

Guided - Use entire disk
   In this scheme, an individual partition is created for each file system.
   Abstraction layers like LVM are not used. During the following step the
   number of file systems or partitions is assigned. The size of the partitions
   is restricted to the size of the respective hard drive.

Guided - Use entire disk and set up LVM
   If the second scheme is selected, a *Logical Volume Group (LVM)* is set up on
   the selected hard drive first. A separate logical volume is then created
   within the volume group for each file system. In this scheme, the size of the
   logical volume is restricted by the size of the volume group, which can also
   be subsequently enlarged with additional hard drives. In case of doubt,
   select this partitioning scheme.

Guided - Use entire disk with encrypted LVM
   This version is the same as the previous version, with the addition that the
   LVM volume group is also encrypted. Consequently, the password for the
   encrypted volume group has to be entered every time the system is started up.

.. caution::

   In all three versions, the existing data on the selected hard drive are
   deleted during the partitioning!

.. _installation-partman-select-guided:

.. figure:: /images/installer-partman-selectguided.*
   :alt: Selecting the partitioning scheme

   Selecting the partitioning scheme

The next step is to select a hard drive from the list of those detected to which
the partitioning version should be applied.

There are three sub versions for each partitioning version, which differ in the
number of file systems created:

All files in one partition
   In this version, just one partition or logical volume is created and the
   :file:`/` file system saved there.

Separate :file:`/home` partition
   In addition to a file system for :file:`/`, an additional file system is also
   created for :file:`/home/`.

Separate :file:`/home`, :file:`/usr`, :file:`/var` and :file:`/tmp` partition
   In addition to a file system for :file:`/`, an additional file system is also
   created each for :file:`/home/`, :file:`/usr/`, :file:`/var/` and
   :file:`/tmp/`.

Before every active change to the hard drive, the change is displayed again in
an additional dialogue and must be confirmed explicitly.

.. _installation-partman-write-lvm:

.. figure:: /images/installer-partman-writelvm.*
   :alt: Confirmation of changes to the hard drive

   Confirmation of changes to the hard drive

Once the partitioning is complete, the UCS basic system and additional software
is installed automatically. This can take some time depending on the speed of
the hardware used. The system is then made ready to boot via the installation of
the GRUB boot loader.

.. _installation-reboot:

.. figure:: /images/installer-reboot.*
   :alt: Finish the installation

   Finish the installation

A restart into the freshly installed system follows subsequently in order to
complete the configuration within it.

.. _installation-domain-settings:

Domain settings
===============

The final configuration of the UCS system is started by selecting a domain mode.
There are three modes available, which influence the following configuration
steps:

Create a new UCS domain
   In the first mode, *Create a new UCS domain*, the first system in a new UCS
   domain is configured: a UCS system with the |UCSPRIMARYDN| system role. In
   the following configuration steps, the information required for setting up a
   new directory service, authentication service and DNS server are requested. A
   UCS domain can consist of one single or several UCS systems. Additional UCS
   systems can be added at a later point in time using the *Join an existing UCS
   domain* mode.

Join into an existing Active Directory domain
   This mode, in which UCS is operated as a member of an Active Directory
   domain, is suitable for expanding an Active Directory domain with
   applications available on the UCS platform. Apps installed on the UCS
   platform are then available for the users of the Active Directory domain to
   use. On selection of this mode, all the relevant information for the joining
   of the Active Directory domain is requested and the UCS system configured
   correspondingly.

Join into an existing UCS domain
   Selecting the *Join into an existing UCS domain* mode allows the UCS system
   to be configured to join an existing UCS domain. What UCS system role it is
   to take on in the domain is queried at a later stage.

.. _installation-domain-role:

.. figure:: /images/installer-domainrole.*
   :alt: Domain settings

   Domain settings

.. _installation-domain-hostname-naming:

Naming convention for hostnames
-------------------------------

.. index::
   single: hostname; naming convention
   single: hostname
   single: hostname; length
   single: hostname; allowed characters

During UCS installation, the domain setup asks for a hostname and a domain name
as *fully qualified domain name*. For compatibility reasons with Samba 4 and
Windows domains, the hostname must adhere to the following naming convention:

* Length from 1 to 13 alpha numeric characters

* Only lower case letters (``a-z``) and numerals (``0-9``)

* Start and end with an alpha numeric character and can contain a hyphen (``-``)
  in between.

The naming convention has the following regular expression:

.. code-block::

   ^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{0,11}[a-z0-9]?$

.. _installation-domain-settings-new-domain:

*Create a new UCS domain* mode
------------------------------

.. index::
   single: hostname; Create new UCS domain

Once the *Create a new UCS domain* mode has been selected, an *organization
name*, an *email address*, a *fully qualified domain name* and an *LDAP base*
are requested in the following two steps.

Specification of an organization name is optional and it is used in the second
step to generate a domain name and the LDAP base automatically.

If a valid email address is specified, this is used to activate a personalized
license, which is required for the use of the Univention App Center. The license
is generated automatically and sent to the specified email address immediately.
The license can then be imported via the UMC module *Welcome!*
(:ref:`central-license`).

The name of the UCS system to be configured and the name of the DNS domain are
determined from the fully qualified domain name (hostname including domain
name) entered here. A suggestion is generated automatically from the
organization name entered in the previous step. It is recommended not to use a
publicly available DNS domain, as this can result in problems during the name
resolution.

For the naming convention of the hostname, refer to
:ref:`installation-domain-hostname-naming`.

A LDAP base needs to be specified for the initialization of the directory
service. A suggestion is also derived here automatically from the fully
qualified domain name. This value can usually be adopted without any changes.

.. _installation-newdomain:

.. figure:: /images/installer-hostname.*
   :alt: Specification of hostname and LDAP base

   Specification of hostname and LDAP base

.. _installation-domain-settings-ad-member:

*Join an existing Active Directory domain* mode
-----------------------------------------------

.. index::
   single: hostname; Join existing Active Directory domain

If the DNS server of an Active Directory domain was specified during the network
configuration, the name of the Active Directory domain controller is suggested
automatically in the *Active Directory account information* step. If the
suggestion is incorrect, the name of another Active Directory domain controller
or another Active Directory domain can be entered here.

The specification of an Active Directory account and the corresponding password
is required for joining the Active Directory domain. The user account must
possess the right to join new systems in the Active Directory domain.

In addition, a hostname must be entered for the UCS system to be configured. The
suggested hostname can be adopted or a new hostname entered. The domain name of
the computer is derived automatically from the domain DNS server. In some
scenarios (e.g., a public mail server) it can prove necessary to use a specific
fully qualified domain name. The UCS system will join the Active Directory
domain with the hostname specified here. Once set up, the domain name **cannot**
be changed again once the configuration is completed.

For the naming convention of the hostname, refer to
:ref:`installation-domain-hostname-naming`.

In a UCS domain, systems can be installed in different *system roles*. The first
UCS system, that joins an Active Directory domain, is automatically installed
with the |UCSPRIMARYDN| system role. If this mode is selected during
installation of additional UCS systems, the system role selection dialogue is
shown. The system roles are described within the following section.

.. _installation-adjoin:

.. figure:: /images/installer-adjoin.*
   :alt: Information on the Active directory domain

   Information on the Active directory domain

.. _installation-domain-settings-join-ucs-domain:

*Join an existing UCS domain domain* mode
-----------------------------------------

.. index::
   single: hostname; Join existing UCS domain

In a UCS domain, systems can be installed in different *system roles*. The first
system in a UCS domain is always installed with the |UCSPRIMARYDN| system role.
Additional UCS systems can join the domain at a later point in time and can be
configured with one of the following system roles.

Backup Directory Node
   The |UCSBACKUPDN| is the fallback system for the |UCSPRIMARYDN|. If the
   latter should fail, a |UCSBACKUPDN| can adopt the role of the |UCSPRIMARYDN|
   permanently. All the domain data and SSL security certificates are saved as
   read-only copies on servers with the |UCSBACKUPDN| role.

Replica Directory Node
   All the domain data are saved as read-only copies on servers with the
   |UCSREPLICADN| role. In contrast to the |UCSBACKUPDN|, however, not all
   security certificates are saved. As accesses to the services running on a
   |UCSREPLICADN| are performed against the local LDAP directory service,
   |UCSREPLICADN| systems are ideal for site servers and the distribution of
   high-load services.

Managed Node
   |UCSMANAGEDNODE|\ s are UCS systems without a local LDAP directory service.
   Access to domain data here is performed via other servers in the domain. They
   are therefore suitable for services which do not require a local database for
   authentication, for example, such as print and file servers.

Once the UCS system role has been selected, further information on the domain
join is requested. If the domain join is not intended to occur automatically
during the installation, the *Start join at the end of the installation* option
can be disabled. If the correct DNS server was selected during the network
configuration, Univention Installer can determine the name of the |UCSPRIMARYDN|
system automatically. If the decision is taken to join another UCS domain, the
*Search Primary Directory Node in DNS* option can be disabled and the fully
qualified domain name of the preferred |UCSPRIMARYDN| entered in the input field
below. The access information required for the domain join must be entered in
the *Administrator account* and *Administrator password* input fields.

.. _installation-join:

.. figure:: /images/installer-join.*
   :alt: Information on the domain join

   Information on the domain join

In addition, a hostname must be entered for the UCS system to be configured in
the next step. The suggested hostname can be adopted or a new hostname entered.
The domain name of the computer is derived automatically from the domain DNS
server. In some scenarios (e.g., a public mail server) it can prove necessary to
use a certain fully qualified domain name. Once set up, the domain name
**cannot** be changed again once the configuration is completed.

For the naming convention of the hostname, refer to
:ref:`installation-domain-hostname-naming`.

.. _installation-confirm-settings:

Confirming the settings
=======================

This dialogue shows the major settings that were made. If all the settings are
correct, the :guilabel:`CONFIGURE SYSTEM` button can be used to start the
configuration of the UCS system, see :numref:`installation-overview`.

The *Update system after installation* option allows the automatic
installation of available Errata updates. In addition, all patch level updates
and Errata updates available are installed on a |UCSPRIMARYDN|. On all other
system roles, all the patch level updates are set up to the installation status
of the |UCSPRIMARYDN|. You need to sign in to the |UCSPRIMARYDN| to check the
installation status. This is done using the login data specified in the join
options.

.. _installation-overview:

.. figure:: /images/installer-overview.*
   :alt: Installation overview

   Installation overview

During the configuration, a progress bar displays the progress of the
installation.

The installation protocol of the Univention Installer is saved in the following
files:

* :file:`/var/log/installer/syslog`

* :file:`/var/log/univention/management-console-module-setup.log`

Completion of the configuration must be confirmed with the :guilabel:`CONFIGURE
SYSTEM` button. The UCS system is then prepared for the first full booting
procedure and restarted.

The system will then boot from the hard drive. Following the boot procedure, the
``root`` and ``Administrator`` users can sign in to the UCS portal page (see
:ref:`central-general`), which can be reached under the IP address set during
the installation or the hostname.

If the computer was installed as the first system in the UCS domain
(|UCSPRIMARYDN|), the license can now be imported (see :ref:`central-license`).

.. _installation-troubleshooting-installation-problems:

Troubleshooting for installation problems
=========================================

Information on possible installation problems can be found in the `Univention
Knowledge base <univention-kb_>`_ in the section *Installation*.

.. _installation-text-mode:

Installation in text mode
=========================

On systems that showed a problem with the graphic variant of Univention
Installer, the installation may be also started in text mode. To achieve this,
in the DVD boot menu *Advanced options* the entry *Install
in text mode* has to be selected.

During installation in text mode Univention Installer shows the same information
and asks for the same settings. After partitioning the hard drive, the system is
prepared for the first boot and finally restarted.

After restart the configuration may be resumed by using a web browser. The URL
:samp:`https://{SERVER-IP-ADDRESS}` or :samp:`http://{SERVER-IP-ADDRESS}` has to be opened
within the browser (HTTPS is recommended). After loading the URL a login as user
``root`` is required.

The configuration process asks for location and network setting and then resumes
with the same steps as the graphic variant of the installation, see
:ref:`installation-domain-settings`.

.. _installation-amazon-ec2:

Installation in the Amazon EC2 cloud
====================================

Univention provides an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) for the Amazon EC2
cloud for UCS. This generic image for all UCS system roles is used to
derive an individual instance which can be configured via |UCSUMC| modules
(domain name, software selection, etc.).

The process for setting up a UCS instance based on Amazon EC2 is documented in
:uv:help:`Amazon EC2 Quickstart <21833>`.

.. _installation-vmware:

Installation in VMware
======================

If UCS is installed as a guest in VMware, select the option
:menuselection:`Linux --> Debian` as the *Guest operating system*, because UCS
is based on Debian.

The Linux kernel used in UCS includes all the support drivers necessary for
operation in VMware (:file:`vmw_balloon`, :file:`vmw_pvsci`, :file:`vmw_vmci`,
:file:`vmwgfx` and :file:`vmxnet3`).

The open source version of the VMware Tools (Open VM Tools) is delivered with
UCS. The tools can be installed using the ``open-vm-tools`` package (they are
not required but do, for example, allow synchronization of the time on the
virtualization server with the guest system).
