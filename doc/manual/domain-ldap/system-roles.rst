UCS system roles
================

In a UCS domain systems can be installed in different *system roles*. The
following gives a short characterization of the different systems.

.. _domain-ldap-primary-directory-node:

|UCSPRIMARYDN|
--------------

A system with the |UCSPRIMARYDN| role is the primary domain controller of a UCS
domain and is always installed as the first system. The domain data (such as
users, groups, printers) and the SSL security certificates are saved on the
|UCSPRIMARYDN|.

Copies of these data are automatically transferred to all servers with the
|UCSBACKUPDN| role.

.. _domain-ldap-backup-directory-node:

|UCSBACKUPDN|
-------------

All the domain data and SSL security certificates are saved as read-only copies
on servers with the |UCSBACKUPDN| role.

The |UCSBACKUPDN| is the fallback system for the |UCSPRIMARYDN|. If the latter
should fail, a |UCSBACKUPDN| can take over the role of the |UCSPRIMARYDN|
permanently (see :ref:`domain-backup2master`).

.. _domain-ldap-replica-directory-node:

|UCSREPLICADN|
--------------

All the domain data are saved as read-only copies on servers with the
|UCSREPLICADN| role. In contrast to the |UCSBACKUPDN|, however, not all security
certificates are synchronized.

As access to the services running on a |UCSREPLICADN| are performed against the
local LDAP server, |UCSREPLICADN|\ s are ideal for site servers and the
distribution of load-intensive services.

A |UCSREPLICADN| cannot be promoted to a |UCSPRIMARYDN|.

.. _domain-ldap-managed-node:

|UCSMANAGEDNODE|
----------------

|UCSMANAGEDNODE| are server systems without a local LDAP server. Access to
domain data here is performed via other servers in the domain.

.. _domain-ldap-ubuntu:

Ubuntu
------

Ubuntu clients can be managed with this system role, see
:ref:`computers-ubuntu`.

.. _domain-ldap-linux:

Linux
-----

This system role is used for the integration of other Linux systems than UCS and
Ubuntu, e.g., for Debian or CentOS systems. The integration is documented in
:cite:t:`ext-doc-domain`.

.. _domain-ldap-macos:

macOS
-----

macOS systems can be joined into a UCS domain using Samba/AD. Additional
information can be found in :ref:`macos-domain-join`.

.. _domain-ldap-domain-trust-account:

Domain Trust Account
--------------------

A domain trust account is set up for trust relationships between Windows and UCS
domains.

.. _domain-ldap-ip-managed-client:

IP client
---------

An IP client allows the integration of non-UCS systems into the IP management
(DNS/DHCP), e.g., for network printers or routers.

.. _domain-ldap-windows-domain-controller:

Windows Domaincontroller
------------------------

Windows domain controllers in a Samba/AD environment are operated with this
system role.

.. _domain-ldap-windows-workstation-server:

Windows Workstation/Server
--------------------------

Windows clients and Windows |UCSMANAGEDNODE|\ s are managed with this system
role.
