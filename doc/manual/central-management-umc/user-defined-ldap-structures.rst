Structuring of the domain with user-defined LDAP structures
===========================================================

Containers and organizational units (OU) are used to structure the data in the
LDAP directory. There is no technical difference between the two types, just in
their application:

* Organizational units usually represent real, existing units such as a
  department in a company or an institution

* Containers are usually used for fictitious units such as all the computers
  within a company

Containers and organizational units are managed in the UMC module
:guilabel:`LDAP directory` and are created with :guilabel:`Add` and the object
types *Container: Container* and *Container: Organisational unit*.

Containers and OUs can in principle be added at any position in the LDAP;
however, OUs cannot be created below containers.
