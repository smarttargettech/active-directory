Mounting of print shares in Windows clients
===========================================

The printer shares set up in the UMC module :guilabel:`Printers` can be added as
network printers on Windows systems. This is done via the Control Panel under
:menuselection:`Add a device --> Add a printer`. The printer drivers need to be
set up during the first access. If the drivers are stored on the server side
(see below), the drivers are assigned automatically.

Printer shares are usually operated using the Windows printer drivers provided.
The network printer can alternatively be set up on the Windows side with a
standard PostScript printer driver. If a color printer should be accessed, a
driver for a PostScript-compatible color printer should be used on the Windows
side, e.g., *HP Color LaserJet 8550*.

.. caution::

   The printer can only be accessed by regular users when they have local
   permissions for driver installation or the respective printer drivers were
   stored on the printer server. If this is not the case, Windows may issue an
   error warning that the permissions are insufficient to establish a connection
   to the printer.

Windows supports a mechanism for providing the printer drivers on the print
server (*Point 'n' Print*). The following guide describes the provision of the
printer drivers in Windows for a print share configured in the UMC
module :guilabel:`Printers`. Firstly, the printer drivers must be stored on the
print server. There are a number of pitfalls in the Windows user wizard, so it
is important to follow the individual steps precisely.

1. Firstly, the printer drivers must be downloaded from the manufacturer's
   website. If you are using an environment in which 64-bit installations of
   Windows are used, you will need both versions of the drivers (32 and 64 bit).
   The :file:`INF` files are required.

#. Now you need to start the :program:`printmanagement.msc` program. Clicking on
   :guilabel:`Add/remove server` in the *Action* menu item allows you to add
   another server. The name of the printer server needs to be entered in the
   *Add server* input field.

#. The newly added printer server should now be listed in the print management
   program. Clicking on :guilabel:`Printers` displays the printer shares
   currently set up on the printer server.

#. Clicking on :guilabel:`Drivers` lists the saved printer drivers. Clicking on
   :guilabel:`Add driver` in the *Action* menu item opens the dialogue window
   for the driver installation.

   We recommend downloading the printer drivers directly from the manufacturer
   and selecting them during the driver installation. If you are using an
   environment containing 64-bit versions of Windows, start by performing a
   check to see if the |UCSUCRV| :envvar:`samba/spoolss/architecture` is set to
   ``Windows x64`` on the UCS Samba system. If this is not the case, both the
   32-bit and the 64-bit drivers must be uploaded; if your domain only uses
   64-bit Windows systems, the 32-bit driver can be ignored. The drivers for the
   different Windows architectures can be uploaded one after the other or
   together.

   If both driver architectures are selected for uploading at the same time, the
   64-bit driver should be selected first in the subsequent file selection
   window. Once Windows has uploaded these files to the server, it asks for the
   location of the 32-bit drivers again. They are then also uploaded to the
   server.

5. After these steps the drivers are stored in the directory
   :file:`/var/lib/samba/drivers/` on the print server.

6. The print share now needs to be linked to the uploaded printer driver. To do
   so, the list of the printers available on the printer server is opened in the
   :program:`printmanagement.msc` program. The properties can be listed there
   by double-clicking on the *printer*.

   .. _printer-selectprinter:

   .. figure:: /images/windows-printerdriver-printerselect.*

7. If no printer driver is saved, a message is displayed saying that there is no
   printer driver installed. The prompt to install the driver should be closed
   with :guilabel:`No` here.

   .. _printer-error:

8. The uploaded driver now needs to be selected from the drop down menu under
   *Drivers* in the *Advanced* tab. Then click on :guilabel:`Apply` (Important:
   **DON'T** click on :guilabel:`OK`!).

9. If the printer driver in question is being assigned to a printer for the
   first time, a dialogue window is shown, asking whether the printer can be
   trusted. This should be confirmed with :guilabel:`Install driver`. The
   printer drivers saved on the server side are now downloaded to the client. If
   the printer driver in question has already been downloaded to the Windows
   system in question in this manner before, Windows displays an error message
   at this point ``0x0000007a``. This can simply be ignored.

10. **Important**: Now, instead of clicking directly on :guilabel:`OK`, you need
    to return to the *General* tab again. The old name for the printer share
    should still be displayed on the tab.

    In UCS releases earlier than UCS 4.0-1, it is possible that the Windows
    system has changed the name of the printer share to the name of the printer
    driver. If that were accepted, the printer would no longer be associated
    with the share!

    If this is the case, the name of the printer on the *General* tab (the first
    input field next to the stylized printer symbol) needs to be reset to the
    name of the print share. This can be done using the *Windows name* field
    configured in the UMC module :guilabel:`Printers` (or if this was left
    blank, use the value from *Name*). If the name has had to be reset in this
    fashion, Windows then asks if you are sure that you want to change the name
    when :guilabel:`OK` is clicked. Confirm the prompt.

11. To give the Windows printer driver the opportunity to save correct standard
    settings for the printer, you now need to switch to the *Device
    settings* tab. The name of the tab differs from manufacturer to manufacturer
    and may also be *Settings* or even just *Configuration*.

    Clicking on :guilabel:`OK` closes the window. You can then print a test
    page. If Windows displays an error message here ``0x00000006``, the printer
    settings must be checked again to see whether there is a
    manufacturer-specific tab called *Device settings* (or something
    similar). If so, it should be opened and then simply confirmed with
    :guilabel:`OK`. This closes the dialogue window and saves the printer
    drivers settings (``PrinterDriverData``) in the Samba registry.

12. At this point, it is also practical to make the settings for the paper size
    and other parameters, so that they are saved in the print share. Other
    Windows systems which subsequently access the print share will then find the
    correct settings automatically. These settings can usually be opened by
    clicking on the :guilabel:`Standard values...` button in the *Advanced* tab
    of the printer settings. The dialogue window which opens also varies from
    manufacturer to manufacturer. Typically, the settings for paper size and
    orientation are found on a tab called *Page setup* or *Paper/Quality*. Once
    the dialogue has been confirmed by clicking on :guilabel:`OK`, the printer
    driver saves these settings (as ``Default DevMode``) for the printer in the
    Samba registry.
