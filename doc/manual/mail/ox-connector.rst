OX Connector
============

:program:`OX Connector` is an app in Univention App Center. It synchronizes
selected users and groups to :program:`OX App Suite` and remote installations
like for example a hosted OX App Suite. Starting with :program:`OX Connector`
version ``2.1.2`` and :program:`OX App Suite` version ``7.10.6-ucs4``, the
:program:`OX Connector` integrates with :program:`OX App Suite` from Univention
App Center to provision user and group accounts to :program:`OX App Suite`.

.. warning::

   :program:`OX App Suite` versions older than ``7.10.6-ucs4`` include their own
   synchronization. :program:`OX Connector` doesn't synchronize with those
   versions and you must therefore not use it with the separate :program:`OX App
   Suite` app from the App Center.

      :cite:t:`ox-connector-doc`.
