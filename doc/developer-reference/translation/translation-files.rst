Editing translation files
=========================

The actual translation process is done by editing translation files which are
named ``<lang>.po``, where ``<lang>`` is an `ISO-639-1 <w-iso-639-1_>`_ language
code. For example, the German code is ``de``, which results in :file:`de.po`
filenames. When following the instructions in the preceding sections, these
files are generated by the package :program:`gettext` behind the scenes. The
manual can be found in `GNU gettext utilities <gettext-manual_>`_.

.. _editing-translation-files-entries:

Editing translation entries
---------------------------

In the following listing shows a simple example of a translation file:

.. code-block:: po

   #: umc/app.js:637
   #, python-format
   msgid "The %s will expire in %d days and should be renewed!"
   msgstr ""

* The first line provides a hint, were the text is used.

* The second line is optional and contains flags, which indicate the type and
  state of the translation.

* The line starting with ``msgid`` contains the original text. The translation
  has to be placed on the line containing ``msgstr``.

For more information about the PO file format, for example about the flags, see
`The Format of PO Files <gettext-po-files_>`_.

Long texts can be split over multiple lines, were each line must start and end with a double-quote.
The following example from the German translation shows a text spanning two
lines, with the placeholder present in the original and translated text:

.. code-block:: po

   #: umc/js/appcenter/AppCenterPage.js:1067
   #, python-format
   msgid ""
   "If everything else went correct and this is just a temporary network "
   "problem, you should execute %s as root on that backup system."
   msgstr ""
   "Wenn keine weiteren Fehler auftraten und dies nur ein temporäres "
   "Netzwerkproblem ist, sollten Sie %s als root auf dem Backup System ausführen."


Some lines contain parameters, in this example ``%s`` and ``%d``. They are
indicated by a flag like ``c-format`` or ``python-format``, which must not be
removed. The placeholders have to be carried over to the translated string
unmodified and in the same order. Some other files contain placeholders of the
form ``%(text)s``, which are more flexible and can be reordered.
Because of that, programmers should always use the form ``%(foo)s``.

After a file has been translated completely, the line containing ``fuzzy`` at
the beginning of the entry must be removed to avoid warnings. If a translation
string consists of multiple lines the translated string should roughly contain
as many lines as the original string.

When a ``msgid`` has changed and a translation existed beforehand, it is marked
with "``#, fuzzy``", as those have to be corrected:

.. code-block:: po

   #: umc/js/appcenter/example.js:42
   #, fuzzy
   msgid "Hello!"
   msgstr "Hallo, Welt!"

Correct the translation in the ``msgstr`` line and remove the line which contains
``fuzzy``:

.. code-block:: po

   #: umc/js/appcenter/example.js:42
   msgid "Hello!"
   msgstr "Hallo!"

.. warning::

   If a ``fuzzy`` entry is still in one of the :file:`de.po` files, the package
   build process fails.

.. _editing-translation-files-meta:

Update meta information
-----------------------

The first entry of a :file:`.po` file contains its meta information, with each line consisting
of a name-value pair.
If the translation work within a file is done, update this information.
As an example, see the following excerpt from a :file:`.po` translation file:


.. code-block:: po

   msgid ""
   msgstr ""
   "Project-Id-Version: univention-management-console-module-services\n"
   "Report-Msgid-Bugs-To: packages@univention.de\n"
   "POT-Creation-Date: 2020-09-25 01:15+0200\n"
   "PO-Revision-Date: 2020-09-25 11:26+0100\n"
   "Last-Translator: Univention GmbH <packages@univention.de>\n"
   "Language-Team: Univention GmbH <packages@univention.de>\n"
   "Language: de\n"
   "MIME-Version: 1.0\n"
   "Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n"
   "Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\n"

Running :command:`univention-l10n-build` updates the ``POT-Creation-Date``. The
``PO-Revision-Date`` should be updated every time the :file:`.po` has been
modified. Insert the `ISO 639 language code <w-iso-639-1_>`_ for the target
translation language into ``Language``. Enter contact information into
``Last-Translator``, ``Language-Team`` and ``Report-Msgid-Bugs-To``.

See the ``gettext`` manual entry about `header entries
<gettext-header-entries_>`_ for more information about all fields, including
optional fields not listed here. Tools like `poedit <poedit_>`_ update some of
the fields automatically for the user.
