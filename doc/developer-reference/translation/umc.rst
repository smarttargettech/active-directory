Create a translation package for UCS
====================================

.. index::
   single: translation
   see: localisation; translation

UCS provides builtin English and German localization and a French translation package. Univention provides a set of tools
that facilitates the creation of translation packages. Translation packages can
provide translations for all translatable strings of UCS for a specific
language. The |UCSUMC|, more specifically its packages, contains the largest
share of translatable strings. This section describes all necessary steps to create a translation package for
UCS.

.. _translation-umc-preparation:

Install needed tools
--------------------

The package :program:`univention-l10n-dev` contains all tools required to set up
and update a translation package. It requires some additional Debian tools to
build the package. Run the following command on UCS to install all needed
packages.

.. code-block:: console

   $ sudo univention-install univention-l10n-dev dpkg-dev git


.. _translation-umc-checkout:

Obtain a current checkout of the UCS Git repository
---------------------------------------------------

The Git repository is later processed to get initial files for a new
translation (often referred to as PO file or Portable Objects).

.. code-block:: console

   $ mkdir ~/translation
   $ cd ~/translation
   $ git clone \
     --single-branch \
     --depth 1 \
     --shallow-submodules \
     https://github.com/univention/univention-corporate-server


.. _translation-umc-create-package:

Create translation package
--------------------------

To create a translation package, for example for French, in the current working
directory, the following command must be executed:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd ~/translation
   $ univention-ucs-translation-build-package \
     --source ~/translation/univention-corporate-server \
     --languagecode fr \
     --locale fr_FR.UTF-8:UTF-8 \
     --language-name French


This creates a new directory :file:`~/translation/univention-l10n-fr/` which
contains a Debian source package of the same name. It includes all source and
target files for the translation.

.. _translation-umc-translate:

Edit translation files
----------------------

The translation source files (:file:`.po` files) are located below the directory
:file:`~/translation/univention-l10n-fr/fr`. Each file should be edited to
create the translation. Refer to :ref:`editing-translation-files` for detailed information.

.. _translation-umc-update-package:

Update the translation package
------------------------------

First update the Git repository:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd ~/translation/univention-corporate-server
   $ git pull --rebase


If changes affecting translations are made in the Git repository, existing
translation packages need to be updated to reflect those changes. Given a path
to an updated Git checkout, :command:`univention-ucs-translation-merge` can
update a previously created translation source package.

The following example updates the translation package
:program:`univention-l10n-fr`:

.. code-block:: console

   $ univention-ucs-translation-merge \
     ~/translation/univention-corporate-server \
     ~/translation/univention-l10n-fr


.. _translation-umc-build-package:

Build the translation package
-----------------------------

Before using the new translation, the Debian package has to be built and
installed. This can be done with the following commands:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd ~/translation/univention-l10n-fr
   $ sudo apt-get build-dep .
   $ dpkg-buildpackage -uc -us -b -rfakeroot
   $ sudo dpkg -i ../univention-l10n-fr_*.deb


After logging out of the |UCSUMC| the new language should now be selectable in
the |UCSUMC| login window. Untranslated strings are still shown in their
original language, that is, in English.
