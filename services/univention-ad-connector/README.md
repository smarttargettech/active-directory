# Univention AD-Connector

## General Operation

* By itself, the AD-Connector doesn't perform automatic reconciliation, i.e. it doesn't actively scan OpenLDAP
  and Active Directory to keep all objects in sync, neither during start up nor periodically.
* The AD-Connector only synchronizes a subset of all attributes, objects and OUs/containers. This subset is
  defined by the mapping.
* Customers must not adjust the `mapping.py` manually anymore (since UCS 5.0) and should instead create a `localmapping.py`.
* When the AD-Connector starts, it first syncs from UDM/OpenLDAP to Active Directory. But it doesn't re-sync everything
  at that point, it just waits for changes.
* Changes from the OpenLDAP site are communicated by the Listener module to AD-Connector via Python `pickle` files
  written into the directory `/var/lib/univention-connector/ad/`. The main loop of the AD-Connector periodically
  checks that directory.
* During each replication cycle, the AD-Connector first checks for changes from OpenLDAP and attempts to write them to
  Active Directory. If an object modification works, the `pickle` file gets removed. If the object modification fails,
  e.g. with a Python traceback, its DN is stored into a table `AD rejected` in `internal.sqlite` in the directory
  `/etc/univention/connector/`.
* During each replication cycle the AD-Connector polls the Active Directory via LDAP for changes (`usnChanged`/
  usnCreated` higher than the last value of `highestCommittedUSN` the AD-Connector has seen during the previous
  replication cycle (following [MS recommendations](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/win32/blob/docs/desktop-src/AD/overview-of-change-tracking-techniques.md)).
  The last seen value of `highestCommittedUSN` is stored in `internal.sqlite`. The AD-Connector attempts to write
  the change to OpenLDAP. If possible it uses the Python UDM API to write changes to OpenLDAP. If object modification
  fails, e.g. with a Python traceback, its DN is stored into a table `UCS rejected` in `internal.sqlite`.

## Developer Information

### Extending AD-Connector to synchronize additional attributes

Updates need special attention when extending ADC to synchronize additional attributes:

#### Active reconciliation for newly added attributes

* Adding new attributes to the AD-Connector mapping doesn't automatically sync all objects with those attributes
  during startup of the AD-Connector. Only for newly modified objects the new mapping is considered.
* Until now we trigger the initial synchronization by creating a script, e.g. `msGPOWQLFilter.py` in the S4-Connector
  which we called in the joinscript. For that the joinscript version needs to be increased, which must not be done
  during an errata update.
* A careful decision need to be made here. There are two options: Either you run the script to first sync from
  OpenLDAP to Active Directory, preferring values in OpenLDAP and possibly overwriting values in Active Directory
  customized by a MS/AD-Admin. The other option is to first trigger a sync from Active Directory to OpenLDAP,
  which may be preferable.
* See e.g. `git log -p --grep "remove msGPOWQLFilter.py"` in S4-Connector for an example how we handled this in the
  past.

Check list for DEV and QA:
==========================
* scripts/prepare-new-instance must work (Regression Bug #50713)
* Instances created with scripts/prepare-new-instance before the
  update must continue to work (see also Bug #51918)

Caveats:
========
* object['attributes'] may contain a mix of OL and AD attributes.
  This can be nasty for attributes like "mail", which exist
  in both object types.

* Warning: mapping of mail related attributes is especially nasty:
** git log --grep "Bug #51647: fix regression of Bug #18501"
** git log --grep "Bug #18501: Fix handling of proxyAddresses mapping"
** git log --grep "Bug #43216: Revised mapping for MS-Exchange related 'proxyAddresses'"

Synchronization of mail attributes:
===================================

* MS-Exchange uses 'proxyAddresses' as attribute for one or more mail-addresses.
* Standard Active Directory uses 'mail' as the default attribute, when filling in an address in the users E-Mail field.
* UCS uses mailPrimaryAddress and mailAlternativeAddress for functional adresses and 'mail' as informational field,
  which may be used for addressbooks

We map them like this (since UCS 4.1-4 Errata Bug #43216):

* UCS:(mailPrimaryAddress, mailAlternativeAddress) <-> AD:proxyAddresses
* UCS:(mailPrimaryAddress, mailAlternativeAddress) |-> AD:mail

The UCR variable connector/ad/mapping/user/primarymail may be used to influence this (TODO: Details).

To make this work a sync_mode='read' hack for mailAlternativeAddress has been introduced
to avoid duplicate ldap.MOD_REPLACE entries in sync_from_ucs modlist


Since UCS 4.4-4 Errata Bug #18501:

  Fix handling of proxyAddresses mapping in combination with the Diff-Mode code:

  We need to compare mapped values in sync_from_ucs, because:

  1. We must use mapped values in case a mapping function is defined,
     not only for single_value attributes.

  2. proxyAddresses is constructed from mailPrimaryAddress *and*
     mailAlternativeAddress. The first is marked by capital "SMTP:"
     prefix in AD, while the other is marked by lowercase "smtp:".

  3. If only mailAlternativeAddress is changed, then still to_proxyAddresses
     needs to be called to construct the new proxyAddresses value, but
     that mapping function is only attached to mailPrimaryAddress.

  Before Diff-Mode, the sync_from_ucs method iterated over attributes
  of the mapped object. I think that makes sense, so we can deal only
  with mapped values in sync_from_ucs. So I adjusted the method
  to get the mapped object_old as argument, instead of the 'old' dict
  from the listener. Then it also doesn't need the 'new' dict either,
  making the code more readable.


Since UCS 4.4-5 Bug #51647 we fixed a regression from UCS 4.4-4 Errata Bug #18501:

  Synchronize AD:"mail" again to UDM:"mailPrimaryAddress"

  There is a delicate interplay between the two post_attribute definitions
  "mailPrimaryAddress_to_mail" and  "mailPrimaryAddress":

  The post_attribute mapping "mailPrimaryAddress_to_mail"
  causes _object_mapping to map AD "mail" to "primaryMailAddress"
  during sync_to_ucs, even if the sync_mode of this post_attribute
  mapping is "read".

  As a result later, in __set_values, "primaryMailAddress" is present
  in "object" and the other post_attribute mapping "mailPrimaryAddress"
  finds this and sets in in UDM.

  The change of Bug #18501 caused only those post_attribute to get
  considered in __set_values, where the con_attribute/con_other_attribute
  actually changed in AD. In only "mail" changed, but proxyAddress didn't,
  then the "primaryMailAddress" post_attribute mapping doesn't get
  called any longer and nothing is changed in UDM.

  This change re-enables the UDM modification.

  It's ugly and it still relies on the hidden handover from "mailPrimaryAddress_to_mail" to "mailPrimaryAddress".


UCS 5.0 Bug #52044 required an adjustment for Python 3:

  In Python 3 the order of dict keys changed, therefore 'proxyAddresses' was before 'mail'.
  The mapping procedure is too complex and has a delicate interplay with the diffmode.
  It should be revised, but that porbably implies improving the way _object_mapping works and
  the way that unmapped and mapped attributes are passed to the sync_from/to_ucs methods
  and the way we iterate over them. That's the point to clean up first, otherwise it's
  just messing around.

Improvement Suggestions:
========================
* Rename "object" and seprate object["attributes"] into "ldap_obj_ol" and "ldap_obj_ad"
  and pass them around to all functions (e.g. ucs_create_functions),
  so they have all required info, can pick the correct attribute values (OL vs AD) in searches
  and don't need to search stuff over and over again.
* Maybe replace "object" by a "obj_replication_state", which holds "ldap_obj_ol" and "ldap_obj_ad"
* Differenciate between "ldap_obj_ol_from_listener" and "ldap_obj_ol_current"
