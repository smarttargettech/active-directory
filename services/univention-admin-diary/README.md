# QA and troubleshooting

This section represent short introduction to some common QA and
troubleshooting tasks.

## Performance

Most performance issues come from the lack of SqlAlchemy join strategy ,which
is not easily detectable when you communicate with a database running locally.
In order to check do you have such problems, first thing is to check does your
code matches [loading relationships] recommendations.

Additionally, to be sure you have fond a bottleneck it would be the best
practice that before changing your code, you first trace sql command executed
by your RDBMS server. This depends on system you are actually using:

### PostgreSql

To trace the sql commands you have to increase the log level of postgres. Log
in via SSH to system where your PostgreSql instance is running and find out
where is configuration file located. There are multiple options available but
simplest one is:

```console
# you have to be superuser
$ su - postgres -c "psql -t -c 'SHOW config_file;' | xargs"
```

Output is something similar to `/etc/postgresql/15/main/postgresql.conf`. For
versions of at least 8.0 you have to apply some configuration changes and
restart the service (you have to be superuser for these):

```shell
# config file (output from the previous block)
$ CFG_FILE="/etc/postgresql/15/main/postgresql.conf"
# backup current configuration file
$ cp "${CFG_FILE}" "${CFG_FILE}.bkp"
# apply changes
$ sed -i\
 -e "s/.*log_statement\s*=.*/log_statement = 'all'/"\
 -e "s/.*log_directory\s*=.*/log_directory = 'pg_log'/"\
 -e "s/.*log_filename\s*=.*/log_filename = 'postgresql-%Y-%m-%d_%H%M%S.log'/"\
 -e "s/.*logging_collector\s*=.*/logging_collector = on/"\
 -e "s/.*log_min_error_statement\s*=.*/log_min_error_statement = error/"\
 "${CFG_FILE}"
# restart service
$ systemctl restart postgresql
```

When finished, restore original configuration and restart the service:

```shell
$ cp "${CFG_FILE}.bkp" "${CFG_FILE}"
$ systemctl restart postgresql
```

### MariaDb

TBD

### MySQL

TBD

### Testing

This chapter will demonstrate how to track performance issues using model from
[backend.py](./python/admindiary/backend.py).

After installing the `univention-admin-diary`, we have to modify existing data
inserted during the installation process. Those are minimal, but will serve the
purpose. We will set first three rows in table `entries` for columns
`context_id` and `message` to some fixed values, e.g.

```console
# you have to be superuser
su - postgres -c "psql -t -d admindiary -c \"UPDATE entries SET context_id = 'ctx1', message = 'msg1' WHERE id < 4;\""
```

If you visit the `portal` -> `Domain` -> `Admin Diary` you will notice first
three records have a note-like icon in `Comments` section. Clicking any of
those should display three comments which are linked with the above SQL
command.

Starting with version **2.0.7-2** of `univention-admin-diary` there are some
improved loading techniques used in oder to lower the number of SQL commands
that has to be executed when populating results. General rule of thumb is: the
fewer queries the better performance is.

You have to observer statements executed by inspecting log file. Please note
that location of this file depends on system - like RDBMS used, its version and
current date. Following is an example of optimized query - there is only one
SQL command executed to get both entries and events:

```

With increased number of related data this will make progressively more SQL
queries leading to unresponsive system.
